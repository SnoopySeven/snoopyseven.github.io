    <h1>January 23, 2023</h1> 
    <p>Many senior high school representatives went here in our school to promote their school. Doesn't matter cuz I picked one that I'm sure. Also used that username from yesterday to make accounts, and it's rare to have a one word account handle, nice. Also my head hurts when I went home, probably my lack of sleep these days.

Even though it's full of cheaters, it's fun to play when there's not. Also it's fun to report exploiters in Evade in Discord, knowing that they'll gonna get banned lmao.</p>
    <h1>January 19, 2023</h1>

Also my pal fricking kissed me, and he said it's the first time he was kissed, in the lips. Guh dayum, I don't know if I should be laughin or be sad about that. Also a friend got pranked to death by teasing his crush(not). LMAO.</p>
    <h1>January 16, 2023</h1>
    <p>So while we are at school, classes got suspended. That was a relief since I can continue the assignments I still haven't done :3 Also when we're going home early, me and an old school friend met our old school friends too. We talked about research and school lmao. Also did a Ralsei cosplay on Roblox, he looks more like a "female". Gonna improve it next time after hehe.</p>
    <h1>January 15, 2023</h1>
    <p>It's cramming time again, "nice". Unlisted my youtube videos so I can make myself more comfortable online, also those videos are cringe lol. Finally found Deltarune Chapter 2 on mobile, actually better than the previous apk. Time to beat Spamton next.</p>
    <img src="Assets\Images\Diary\spamton_dance.gif">
    <p>Also, another pal is sad again. He also asked me a question what's my motivation in continuing things even though I want to give up. I'm not really into these things, but I answered, because he's my friend. If I could only help him though...</p>
    <h1>January 14, 2023</h1>
    <p>It's my twitter anniversary today. Two years of doing shitposts and stuff to that account. Also tried Dead Cells, actually pretty good ngl. Also I'm having fun with the Ralsei ai text generator. It's funny trolling him, altough it's fake, it felt real. Forgot to mention that I'm not drinking any coffee for weeks now. I always almost vomitting after drinking it. Also my parents are gonna throw away that one cat who's always annoying. It's nice knowing that cat, I'll miss her.</p> 
    <h1>January 13, 2023</h1>
    <p>I'm having fun with an ai character text generator. It's really funny when I do dark things. Maybe I'm a psychopath lmao. Also tried Goat Simulator, it's fun. It's running good now when I did the accidental graphics card change :D</p>
    <img src="Assets\Images\Diary\ralsei_spin_2.gif">
    <h1>January 12, 2023</h1>
    <p>Got 1000 wins noow in Evade. Took me many, many hours to achieve that. I should really need to touch grass. Also I forgot to mention that after I wake up yesterday, my fucking left leg is painful. I can't even stand up. Luckily it's only for a short while.</p>
    <img src="Assets\Images\Diary\ralsei_spin.gif">
    <h1>January 11, 2023</h1>
    <p>I finally fixed the graphics stuttering in my pc. Feels good to play games again on fullscreen! Also a chill day today, except on school. We always blame one guy on the classrom, and it's funny lmao. He's not angry so it's okay yeah.</p>
    <h1>January 10, 2023</h1>
    <p>I got fucking trolled at school. Someone told me to smell his hands. Then guess what, it's fucking disgusting. Never again. Also finally passed all the assignments I did from last night, I hope it was worth it. And it's a funny day in school overall. Also did a "funny" in Geometry Dash, pipe.</p>
    <img src="Assets\Images\Diary\kris_dance_3.gif" width="500" height="500">
    <h1>January 9, 2023</h1>

But the comments are cool, so yeah, I should stop overthinkin. Also another sad night for me, I always feel this. One day, it will be normal for me... And the sad truth is that nobody actually cares about it. Also drank beer tonight to cope with things happening rn. A temporary way to get out of everything.</p>
    <h1>December 18, 2022</h1>
    <p>Cold Sunday today. Also Christmas, just a week away, oh wow. I am so happy about this information. Also took a pic of myself and edited it, and posted it. Lmao.</p>

    <h1>December 17, 2022</h1>
    <p>Maybe I should stop overreacting, sadness will go away soon. Might stay silent today. Also spotted a funny cat under our cat, looks like my old cat back when I was a kid. Also drew something to practice my pixel art, without tracing. It's a meh for me, but it looks like I'm slowly improving.</p>
    <h1>December 16, 2022</h1>
    <p>Edited this entry using Visual Studio Code, remote browser is good. Also added a puzzle section on my miscellaneous links, it's fun making those puzzles. Btw those puzzles are finished so you can't enter the answer anymore, you'll just see how I did it.<br>Feeling depressed again this night, I don't know why... Also added "something" in my Discord description. </p>
    <h1>December 15, 2022</h1>
    <p>Did a website overhaul, again, in my site. Cleaned up the codes and also used Visual Stuido to do it. I'm now satisfied in my site. Also next time I will learn how to make my site more responsive. Also I'm going to stop "optimizing" my code, It's <strong>really</strong> fucking hard to understand the code when I do that.</p>
    <h1>December 14, 2022</h1>

Also went home late (6PM) cuz of a fuckin activity that we need to continue, and I only contributed like 2 times bruh.</p>

    <p>I hate this research thing (maybe skill issue I guess). Also noticed one of my pals is uh, how do I say this. Happy in the outside but he's dead inside. I feel that too sometimes. Also the small wound on my leg is a fucking insect bite, and it isn't healing in weeks. Also first time still awake until midnight, cuz of assignments.</p>

    <h1>November 7, 2022</h1>
    <p>I got a 78 grade on Math, what a good way to start the Monday... I feel dead inside after that, always been. Also I feel unmotivated on the morning, too tired on school. Also ate two ice creams, and my gums is fucking swelling. I almost cried on a certain time on school. Overall, an emotional day, sadness and shit. Tired of lying...</p>
    <h1>November 6, 2022</h1>
    <p>It's my father's birthday today. We're just going to celebrate it simple by just eating delicous food for today. We also did a 1 hour walking trip with my younger siblings far away from home. Also I'm finally going to school tomorrow after many days of no classes.<br><br>P.S. I forgot on Friday (November 4) that it's the 3rd year of my steam account.</p>

    <h1>November 5, 2022</h1>
    <p>I feel empty today, no emotions, I might not wanna talk to friends right now... We're also going to eat outside to celebrate our grandma's birthday, although it's actually her birthday last week. Better late than never.</p>
    <h1>November 4, 2022</h1>
    <p>Lonely morning, nothing interesting to do this time, as always. I got level 75 on a Roblox game after many hours, worth it. Also I feel like shit today, not doing anything productive or good. Like, I don't wanna exist anymore, same things I do everyday.</p>
    <h1>November 3, 2022</h1>
    <p>Finally that guy accepted my friend request on steam, took him like months. I also fried some chicken for lunch. Colored a certain pfp, and it took me many tries :/ . Also got fucking banned from that Discord server from yesterday, and I didn't do anything "bad" yet. Well shit.</p>

    <p>I got 1000 visits on this site and idk why. Still learnin' how to use HTML till now. No school for me this week cuz of a storm. Also I got a time out on some certain Discord server, if you know what I mean. I also unfortunately failed No Bruh November (yes). Why am I doing diary here? Im doing it because I wanna do basic HTML, and share my experience. Also doin' this to improve my English skills.</p>
