	<h1>Diary I Wrote</h1>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Writing my life, one line at a time, I guess?</h2><br><h1>November 2, 2022</h1><p>I got 1000 visits on this site and idk why. Still learnin' how to use HTML till now. No school for me this week cuz of a storm. Also I got a time out on some certain Discord server, if you know what I mean. I also unfortunately failed No Bruh November (yes). Why am I doing diary here? Im doing it because I wanna do basic HTML, and share my experience. Also doin' this to improve my English skills.</p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/Rpq8-r2iJFcAAAAM/sans-sans-undertale.gif"><br><h1>November 3, 2022</h1><p>Finally that guy accepted my friend request on steam, took him like months. I also fried some chicken for lunch. Colored a certain pfp, and it took me many tries :/ . Also got fucking banned from that Discord server from yesterday, and I didn't do anything "bad" yet. Well shit.</p><img src="https://i.redd.it/hfor6od4dwl61.gif"><h1>November 4, 2022</h1><p>Lonely morning, nothing interesting to do this time, as always. I got level 75 on a Roblox game after many hours, worth it. Also I feel like shit today, not doing anything productive or good. Like, I don't wanna exist anymore, same things I do everyday.</p><h1>November 5, 2022</h1><p>I feel empty today, no emotions, I might not wanna talk to friends right now... We're also going to eat outside to celebrate our grandma's birthday, although it's actually her birthday last week. Better late than never.</p><h1>November 6, 2022</h1><p>It's my father's birthday today. We're just going to celebrate it simple by just eating delicous food for today. We also did a 1 hour walking trip with my younger siblings far away from home. Also I'm finally going to school tomorrow after many days of no classes.<br><br>P.S. I forgot on Friday (November 4) that it's the 3rd year of my steam account.</p><img src="Files/weed.gif"><h1>November 7, 2022</h1><p>I got a 78 grade on Math, what a good way to start the Monday... I feel dead inside after that, always been. Also I feel unmotivated on the morning, too tired on school. Also ate two ice creams, and my gums is fucking swelling. I almost cried on a certain time on school. Overall, an emotional day, sadness and shit. Tired of lying...</p><h1>November 8, 2022</h1><p>Another good thing to start the day, forgot something on the house and I need to go back again. Also accidentaly turned on the shower, and I got fucking wet when I'm wearing clothes. I also failed a test, because I didn't see the choices, fuck. Anxiety is high again... Also saw the blood moon tonight, rare sight to see. My friend got rejected, maybe?<br><br>P.S.<br>This site got 3000 views, wtf.</p><img src="https://emoji.discadia.com/emojis/15534cd7-47d6-4abf-a47f-ebe42c35d9b8.GIF"><h1>November 9, 2022</h1><p>Interesting day today, finally. Me and my friends hangout in a coffee shop, is gud. Also barely passed two tests, yep. Also, no more anything too interesting happened today so meh.</p><img src="Files/kris.gif"><h1>November 10, 2022</h1><p>I just found a Discord alternative, Guilded. Faster and better for me, also you can have Discord nitro features here for free :3 . Bruh, I accidentaly bleed my thumb after trying to open a can using a can opener. Also played Minecraft with mah friend, got diamonds on just an hour, cool.</p><img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/2295_Ralseidefaultdancefixed.gif"><h1>November 11, 2022</h1><p>Am doin some pixel art on Geometry Dash. Possible but will take time :3. Also cramming with a stupid assignment we have, and it's so impractical.</p><video controls width="800" height="600"><source src="https://img.guildedcdn.com/ContentMediaGenericFiles/46c9a7315d915dff09246e313891b293-Full.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><video controls width="800" height="600"><source src="https://img.guildedcdn.com/ContentMediaGenericFiles/20a58a87fa610ba2c7c9f6ffabbba7ba-Full.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><p>It's happening to me again... I don't understand this feeling, but it's happening to me again, like something bad will happen...</p><h1>November 12, 2022</h1><p>Drew my cat today, cuz I'm bored. Also another depressing weekend for me... As always no one's interested to me. ALSO I FINALLY MAKED A LONG LEVEL ON GEOMETRY DASH!</p><h1>November 13, 2022</h1><p>My keyboard broke, now I'm going to use my old keyboard and it sucks smh. I also uploaded the GD level cuz I don't have anything to add to it. Also feeling useless again right now...</p><h1>November 14, 2022</h1><p>Haven't passed the assignment i've been crammin since November 10. fuck that shit. Also feeling good today, well that's rare. Also played POSTAL, good shit.</p><h1>November 15, 2022</h1><p>Drew Postal Dude on school, why not. Also our "Research" thing of our group is fucked, lolz.

I don't wanna talk about it anymore.</p><h1>November 17, 2022</h1><p>Feeling sick after waking up. Hard to breathe and coughing, fuck. Also cooked some noodles for snack.</p><h1>November 18, 2022</h1><p>Still feeling sick, but only a little bit now. Aaaaanddd another depressing weekend again. And only when they need something, sigh. I'll just be silent for now If i can. Also I'm gonna stop forcing or trying "things", and I'll just stop, as "he" said. Also drew Asriel on a graphing paper for an assignment. Finally, a homework I can enjoy.</p><h1>November 19, 2022</h1><p>Totally normal day today. I just finished some few assignments and things. And also added a classmate on Steam, nice I guess. Also still coping to what I did on a certain site, AAAAAA.</p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/6Mz4edQ_ZUIAAAAC/noelle-sad-spongebob-sad.gif" width="300" height="300"><h1>November 20, 2022</h1><p>Got some Robux today after grindin, worth it :3</p><h1>November 21, 2022</h1><p>One our pal didn't go to school, cuz sick. Also nothing too interesting happened today, meh I guess.</p><h1>November 22, 2022</h1><p>I'll say it's a little good day. Just presented an assignment with little preparation, and got commended. Also did some pixel art, but on digital. Drew Ralsei, yeah. I also attended a school event, called Family Feud. It's an okay event I guess. Also sad way to end the day, alone going home.</p><h1>November 23, 2022</h1><p>My pal is threatening me, as joke. Or is it? Also some stranger said goodbye to me after I exit a transport vehicle, I smiled and felt good.</p><h1>November 24, 2022</h1><p>Nothing too much happened today. Still anxious about our research project though. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p><h1>November 25, 2022</h1><p>Some idiot scammer added me on steam this morning, I had a fun time trolling him. Also got a developer badge on discord, and I faked it. We also discussed some project on a vc, and it's fucking funny and stupid.</p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/oBmj-hskOskAAAAC/rouxls-triggered.gif"><h1>November 26, 2022</h1><p>Boring day, aaaaaaandddd the deadline for our research is near.

Also noticed one of my pals is uh, how do I say this. Happy in the outside but he's dead inside. I feel that too sometimes. Also the small wound on my leg is a fucking insect bite, and it isn't healing in weeks. Also first time still awake until midnight, cuz of assignments.</p><h1>November 29, 2022</h1><p>G'day today. I really hope the assignment I did is right, from yesterday. Also a friend of mine ordered food and put some red sauce. He thought it was ketchup, he doesn't know that it's hot sauce LMAO. Stupid me ate it for free cuz he don't want it. It fuckin hurts on the tongue AAAAAAAAA. Also went home late (6PM) cuz of a fuckin activity that we need to continue, and I only contributed like 2 times bruh.</p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/913609608852021252/1046740770780102756/when_the.gif"><p>P.S.<br>Forgot to say that I met my old classmate on my way home.
