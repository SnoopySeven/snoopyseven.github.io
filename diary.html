    <h1>Diary I Wrote</h1>
    <h2>Writing my life, one line at a time, I guess?</h2>
    <h1>December 3, 2023</h1>
    <p>First time participating in the church, I just litted up the candle. That's tough, lol. Also while we are buying stuff with the family, I put the sandals that my brother put in the cart back. My mom didn't notice it lol. Anyways I wear sandals now inside, to prevent my feet getting cold I guess. Also my friends are ranting in the Discord server at night rn, better not interrupt them. Also we did gartic phone this late at night, it was fucking fun.</p>
    <h1>December 2, 2023</h1>
    <p>Dad's not here again because of anothe paneling shit I guess. Also I tried to do the code again for our Java game, it's starting to make sense for me now.</p>
    <h1>December 1, 2023</h1>
    <p>It's December now grinches, damn time flies so fast ong. It's such a boring day today in class lol. Also edited our "fan club" group chat photo to add our ICT teacher. Also I'm drawing again this night, I'm slowly improving. Also I checked my Spotify wrapped, I'm very close to 69,420 minutes of listening man and I listened too much. Better luck next year lol.</p>
    <h1>November 30, 2023</h1>
    <p>My dad is now here, brought some mcdonalds too, nice. Also found some good BMTH songs, I'm slowly getting into their discography. I fucking love screaming metal shit. Also while waiting in school, I heard a jeepney with a fucking yamete sound. I hate this country man.</p>
    <h1>November 29, 2023</h1>
    <p>Forgot to wrote that my dad went to another city for a panelling thing. He's not here until thursday. Also I went to a club activity this day, and we won. We only need 2 Java problems to be solved to win lol. All of the problems are frickin' hard. Also my mother's sister added all of our cousin in a gc, truly unexpected.</p>
    <h1>November 28, 2023</h1>
    <p>I speedran my Java and HTML activity today. And my ICT teacher doesn't have any more activities to give to me lol. So he made some more during HTML time and I completed it fast too. Also in our media literature time, I speedran the debugging thing too. I'm the first one to finish.</p>
    <h1>November 27, 2023</h1>
    <p>I got two fucking wet dreams in a row. I HATE MY LIFE. Anyways, I found a good PvE Roblox game, mostly played it this day. Also I finally finished "If Undertale was Realistic", two days ago. It was a funny series, worth the watch.</p>
    <h1>November 26, 2023</h1>
    <p>Yep went to the church again, nothing special. Also tried Deltatraveler this night, might finish it tomorrow idk.</p>
    <h1>November 25, 2023</h1>
    <p>It's so rainy again today, I had to move my computer a bit because of the droplets in the ceiling. Also Kas and Jay went to our house. Really random, but yeah. Apparently they have plans today, but it didn't happened. So they just went to our house lol.</p>
    <h1>November 24, 2023</h1>
    <p>While I'm waiting for a jeepney, I found Leo in the jeep lol. So yeah, I rode with him and talking about PvZ shit. Also I borrowed a laptop of a classmate to test some code, and she can look at all of it anyways lol. Also we don't have any Philosophy class today so we just did an activity, which requires internet lol. Also we need to take some photographs for our activity, and I took an epic one. It's just a fucking piece of brown paper lol. Also in our Discord server of our ICT class, our teacher is thanking us. We made him happy in his teachings, despite all of his problems.</p>
    <h1>November 23, 2023</h1>
    <p>We actually did our roleplay well today, I can't actually believe it lol. We only had one and a half hour to practice. Also Leo got that priest drip lol, everyone's impressed with that, even our teacher. Also I'm trying to learn our current java lesson this night, it's actually fucking hard man, I'm sleepy writing this. Also I'm watching "If Undertale was Realistic" tonight too, it's funny so far. Also my free trial nitro is officially out now lol, goddamn time flies so fast.</p>
    <h1>November 22, 2023</h1>
    <p>Our leader called for a practice this afternoon. And only three of us got there. This is the group of all time. Also me and Raven connect to Mav's internet, then sent a screenshot of it in the server. He noticed it lol.</p>
    <h1>November 21, 2023</h1>
    <p>We had the hardest Java coding today so far, oh man it's getting harder now. Also in our HTML coding, it's much more fun. I created a blog with memes, and it looks decent too lol. Also I got vaccinated with the flu vaccine in the office. 1 year protection, neat.</p>
    <h1>November 20, 2023</h1>
    <p>Yep, the expected thing happened. We are not prepared for the roleplay thing and we have to do it again next meeting. Goddamnit. Also the ice cream machine in the ministop is now back. And the flavor was the salted caramel thingy. Not a fan of it though. Also my sister got top place on a journalism competition so my parents bought some good chicken with a good sauce. Truly the food of all time.<p>
    <h1>November 19, 2023</h1>
    <p>Went to church again. I got a feelingt that this will happened again next week, oh well. Also went to shopping after that. Also we have a two group presentation tomorrow and I barely prepared. Good luck to me I guess.</p>
    <h1>November 18, 2023</h1>
    <p>I reformatted my Windows installation again. I'm never tinkering my installation again this time fr.</p>
    <h1>November 17, 2023</h1>
    <p>I got into the car again, this time it's my mom that had to go early. Also the soy that I drank yesterday made my stomach go crazy lol. Never buying it again. Also many old classmates of mine got in the top 10 of the highest score in our SHS exams. Including Leo and Charles too. Also we practiced our rolepay in this afternoon, yeah. Also I'm rushing writing my diary this night because I'm too lazy again and my dad is shouting lol.</p>
    <h1>November 16, 2023</h1>
    <p>My dad brought me halfway to my school because of rain, and the jeepneys are full again. Luckily there's a vacant jeepney after I got out. Also we're only half-day today. The subjects teacher got sick, damn. Also on my way home, I suddenly remebered we have a practice before we go home. The practice got moved tomorrow lol because most of my groupmates are on the way home too. Also visited the "trading website" again. Posted a thing with a code to a video.</p>
    <h1>November 15, 2023</h1>
    <p>Really rainy today, and I have no class today. Also played Blox Fruits mostly this day, still, it's too grindy lol. Nothing else happened today.</p>
    <h1>November 14, 2023</h1>
    <p>He's absent again, oh well. It's mostly a good day today, I guess. I'm almost late again at school lol. Also I waited a long time in line just to get some chicken nuggets because their chicken is not available in the store. I wanna get out of this hellhole of a country (probably not). Also my younger brother tried to verify his payment app, and he forgot the pin. Bruh. Also in the class yesterday, they didn't even approach me during Oral Comm for the groupings. How am I supposed to know what group I am. I joined the group chat today anyways, and they didn't even invite me there too. Oh right, the Roblox VC is not permanent lol. I just found out about it today. It's good while it lasted. Also met Neil on the jeepney, an old classmate.</p>
    <h1>November 13, 2023</h1>
    <p>Leo is absent again, and I feel like shit in school. He's my only true close friend there, I'm really fucking bad at socializing. Oh well, can't do anything about it then. Also I'm having fun using vc on Roblox, it's really goofy. Oh I hope I don't get banned while using vc. (Please don't jinx it my November 13 self).</p>
    <h1>November 12, 2023</h1>
    <p>We went to church again, didn't mostly enjoy it at first. I blame those noisy children in there. After that, we ate at the foodcourt, and my dad met his old teacher there. I had a short, awkward conversation with her lol. Also our chicken got butchered now, and I fucking ate it. Oh well, it was delicious atleast. Also I accidentally got the voice chat feature on Roblox when I used a VPN. I think it's permanent now when I turned the VPN off lol.</p>
    <h1>November 11, 2023</h1>
    <p>I shaved my moustache today, I look much cleaner with just my beard. I also watched "The Amazing Digital Circus", and yeah, Caine does actually acts like Spamton in the show. The show was good I guess.</p>
    <h1>November 10, 2023</h1>
    <p>I "accidentally" tried the free trial of Discord nitro, it only redeems in mobile I guess. Also I had a hard time getting into a jeepney this morning, I woke up later than usual lol. Also I passed the HTML and Java test, didn't surprise me fr. Also in our nath time, it's fun lol. We just had games and shit like that, and it's all about math. Math is fun when it's interesting. Also we watched some film trailers that students made including us today. Most of them are about horror and romance lol. Also I drank coffee while waiting in the office in the afternoon. Welp, I still feel sleepy while writing this thing.</p>
    <h1>November 9, 2023</h1>
    <p>This day today is very good, until it wasn't lol. Long story short, our teachers revealed our scores, and I passed both two test. And my friends passed too, nice. When it's our 21st Century time, our teacher gave us a warning that most of our groupmates didn't contribute. Well, mostly all of us contributed anyways. Also my mom gave us a task, and me and Leo got a free donut. </p>
    <h1>November 8, 2023</h1>
    <p>Used a file recovery tool on my disk today, I found my old Warcraft III files there. I feel like an old man right now lol. Also did a fucking dance exercise for a subject, and I have surpassed the 1 minute mark. I hope that my teacher will still accept it. </p>
    <h1>November 7, 2023</h1>
    <p>Drew myself again with a christmas hat as my Facebook profile pictire lol. Also posted a roblox meme in my story while I'm at it too. Also took my two last exams today. Both are easy, so no worries. Also I finally verified my payment app after a year. I didn't feel lazy this time lol.</p>
    <h1>November 6, 2023</h1>
    <p>We had two exams today. The last part of our Java exam is, well, coding in a fucking paper. I can't even remember the scanner one without looking at the questions. Also me and Raven waited long for Leo lol, apparently he hasn't received the discount for the tution thing. Also in our way to the ministop, a kitten delayed us. It keeps meowing on us, maybe it's distressed?</p>
    <h1>November 5, 2023</h1>
    <p>We went to the church today, inside a mall. Didn't know that a church inside a mall exists lol. Also after that we ate too. All of that is an early celebration of my Dad's birthday. We have school tomorrow lol.</p>
    <h1>November 4, 2023</h1>
    <p>I woke up very early in the morning and can't sleep for a bit. Probably because it's hot? Also changed my pfp in Discord with my alt to the Christmas one. Early celebration eh. Also my grandmother also went here for a bit, they're gonna wait for the x-ray thingy.</p>
    <h1>November 3, 2023</h1>
    <p>Took the three tests this afternoon, and the math one is the only thing that is hard this day. What a surprise. Also my Dad brought a chicken last night. I don't even know if he's going to cook it or making it a pet. Also I sat on the entrance of the jeepney, because it was full, with an old elementary friend. It was nice talking to him.</p>
    <h1>November 2, 2023</h1>
    <p>I have some exams tomorrow, goodluck to me I guess. Also my website is now officially 1 year old. I forgot to say this on November 1 since it's the date of it.</p>
    <h1>November 1, 2023</h1>
    <p>What a good start of November, of course. I've been forced to go to the complex again this afternoon, and I mostly didn't enjoy it. Also the Evade halloween and overhaul was supposed to be released today, and it got delayed again. Hopefully it will be okay tomorrow.</p>
    <h1>October 31, 2023</h1>
    <p>My parents went home early today, I'm suprised lol. Also our cat Audrey gave birth to three kittens. Each have different colors. Also changed my Discord avatar to Papyrus, it's halloween time.</p>

    <p>Nothing really happened today, except that I found an another obscure Roblox game. </p>
    <h1>October 29, 2023</h1>
    <p>We went to my grandma's birthday today. They said that I'm so tall in my age lmao. Also went to the grocery too after that.</p>
    <h1>October 28, 2023</h1>
    <p>My father added a sink in our garden outside. Like wtf, my mother is the only one that will use it lol. And I had another sweaty Item Asylum session this night lol. I really love underrated Roblox games man.</p>
    <h1>October 27, 2023</h1>
    <p>We had math class again, and I can't understand a single shit. Meh, where am I going to use that knowledge anyways (I might regret saying this lol.). Also I finally got bird up in Item Asylum, got it by stealing someone's "judge" lol. Also rode the wrong fucking jeep. I really need to read those signs this time.</p>
    <h1>October 26, 2023</h1>
    <p>I showered last night, because my hair is fucking itchy. Well, it's a relief for me. Also my cat Mohawk fucking ate half of the fish in our kitchen. I really hate that cat.</p>
    <h1>October 25, 2023</h1>
    <p>I played Midnight Horrors again, it's still fun grinding some survivals lol. Also I'll be trying to use Microsoft Edge for a while, it looks faster than Chrome so why not give it a try.</p>
    <h1>October 24, 2023</h1>
    <p>I forgot to mention that there's a short pipe leak in our house yesterday. My pinky finger bled after I used the mop. Unlucky me. Also today I finally finished that array java thing that our teacher gave to us. Only two of us is done with that shit lol. Also after that I ate some siomai with Leo, and went home after that. And while I'm playing Evade at 8PM, he joined too lol. It's just short so yeah.</p>
    <h1>October 23, 2023</h1>
    <p>We took a test and checked it today. Me and Leo got the same passing score lol. Luckily I read the reviewer my teacher sent. Also I made the Evade game-discussion channel delusional for a bit, we really need the overhaul update now lol.</p>
    <h1>October 22, 2023</h1>
    <p>I went to complex, by just walking. That was worth it, I guess. Also I met Jay there too, he's there to practice with his classmates. Also I now like Jevil as a character, for some reason. Chaos? Also the Roblox servers today are so fucking laggy, it's because of just ONE Blox Fruit update, JUST ONE.</p>
    <h1>October 21, 2023</h1>
    <p>Finally got Robux after about 4 months of waiting, worth the wait. Bought some more cosplays because of that. Nothing much happened today.</p>
    <h1>October 20, 2023</h1>
    <p>Now I feel really sick today, and I feel cold too. Also there are only few jeepneys when I'm waiting in the afternoon. So I just rode in the car with my parents home. Before that, me and my mom went to a store to buy some food and stuff. And waited for my brother in my previous high school. What a tiring day. Also I found a good Aphex Twin track, and I might get into this artist too.</p>
    <h1>October 19, 2023</h1>
    <p>I'm waiting for a jeepney this rainy morning, and my dad distracted me from an available one. I had to wait another fucking minutes for that. Also we danced on our PE class, and I didn't even memorized the dance. I just improvised and copied the better dancers lol. Also I almost finished Undertale again on true pacifist. I beaten this game many times now lol. Also I feel sick after school, god damn rain. Also we met some of our old classmates today after I guessed it. Coincidence? Probably. Also I (ChatGPT) wrote the Meet The Madcap script from TF2, a fucking joke class. I posted it in the Steam forums, and people don't like it lol. Anyways I don't care anymore about it.</p>
    <h1>October 18, 2023</h1>
    <p>Elca used my funny blender render as his Facebook cover. I'm confused on how he got that. Oh well, it's easy to make tho. Also it's Kas's birthday today, I can finally send that buff soldier meme. Also greeted Jay too, even though it's 6 days late. Better than nothing. Also resetted my phone back to default, I think it's much faster.</p>
    <h1>October 17, 2023</h1>
    <p>Our computer progamming teacher is sick, so we don't have any lessons this morning and afternoon. Early dismissal for us yeah. Also drew the album cover of Dalek and Death Grips combined, looks sick.Also we had test for Philosophy, I only did good on the essay part lol. Also my pants got dripped by  chocolate while I'm eating chocolate bread. I hope my parents don't notice it. Also I'm now planning our text-based game in paint.net, and progamming it in java. Why did they make me a leader man.</p>
    <h1>October 16, 2023</h1>
    <p>I woke up early today, I thought my class was 7AM lol. Also I tried Firefox again, and I just uninstalled it again cause of some website compatibility issues. Fuck you Chrome for dominating the internet. Also we supposed to have no classes because of a jeepney strike, and we're not included in it bruh. Because of that, when I'm waiting for a jeepney, it's always full lol. Took me a while to get one. Also I played Omori for the first time, I'll probably regret this.</p>
    <h1>October 15, 2023</h1>
    <p>Forgot to mention that I had a weird dream yesterday. I'm being chased in some kind of small building. I'm in some stairs and I escaped, but with my limbs chopped lol. Weekend dreams are so bizzare man. Also I discovered another experimental hip hop group. Their first song is so good. I might get into this band, maybe. Also we went to the complex again this morning, this time they brought a volleyball. I didn't even get to play it lol.</p>
    <h1>October 14, 2023</h1>
    <p>It's been many weeks now and I still haven't acted on our ILS yet. It looks like they're having fun, I really wanna join man :sob:.</p>
    <h1>October 13, 2023</h1>
    <p>We're only half-day today, nice. Also they said they felt an earthquake, but I didn't notice it. Probably because I was buying on recess lol. Also BMTH just released a new single today, goddamn it sounds good, as always. Can't wait for their Nex Gen album. Also it's Friday the 13th today, doesn't feel like it lol.</p>
    <h1>October 12, 2023</h1>
    <p>Our teacher in Oral Comm didn't come, he's probably mad at us. Also Raven went to the office the first time, he's a trusted recruit now lol. Also when I went to the Ministop with Leo, we talked about his other personalities. He apparently had DID, a disorder. I'm really confused and amazed on how a person can do that.</p>
    <h1>October 11, 2023</h1>
    <p>Mah internet is acting up rn, can't even play Roblox with a completely loaded game. Why am I so unlucky when there's no classes man. Also found a good song by Mike Shinoda, a co-founder of Linkin Park. His song is so loopable god damn./p>
    <h1>October 10, 2023</h1>
    <p>We have no math again man, it's been a week without it. Our teacher was sick bruh. Also a friend took a shit on the school bathroom, and I had to guard him LOL. Also it's my sisters birthday today, and a delicious chocolate cake was brought. Also I'm starting to get deep into Linkin Park, and found out that High Voltage by YFM was a cover of a Linkin Park song. Damn it's good.</p>
    <h1>October 9, 2023</h1>
    <p>A really bad start in the morning man, we got preached by our teacher in the first class. We're too annoying he said, and he cried. Third time this happened in my life where teachers cried. Also I keep updating my Roblox game, just to be more accurate to our room yes.</p>
    <h1>October 8, 2023</h1>
    <p>We celebrated my sister's birthday early today, which was supposed to be on October 10. We ate outside because of that yeah, also shopped some things on the way too. Also a Ciara is back in our new server, she's banned because of the leak in our old server yeah. Also procrastinating again this night, ehhhhhhh.</p>
    <h1>October 7, 2023</h1>
    <p>We went to complex this morning, I've been forced to jog lol. I didn't really enjoy it though. Also I focused on recreating our classroom almost all day in Roblox. It's getting good now.</p>
    <h1>October 6, 2023</h1>
    <p>I went to the said mall from yesterday, and we played in the computer shop thing lol. Played with Leo in the Booth Game at Roblox. It's funny seeing him interacting with those people as Obama lol. Anyways the bands and dancers is so good. Also I thought my parents' gonna get late this night, and coincidentally, they're here at 8PM, the time I thought that. And they brought some McDonalds too, neat. Also I reacreated my bottle pose in Roblox, looks good enough I guess.</p>
    <h1>October 5, 2023</h1>
    <p>I did some push ups and curl ups for our PE class this morning. The curl ups was a pain in my chest lol. Also we had no classes with teaching today, everyone's preparing for the teachers' day (today). Also when we ate at the office, there's some fuckin good food there. We don't need to buy food yes. Also I wore a mask from "Money Heist" while listening to Death Grips, inside the classroom. I look goofy there lol. Also I went to the mall with my mom afterschool, it's boring there. They need to set up things for tomorrow, yeah I'm gonna go to the same mall again. Also I'm trying to make our school room in Roblox. I hope it doesn't go to the long list of things I haven't completed lol.</p>
    <h1>October 4, 2023</h1>
    <p>I'm finally back in my normal Discord profile. Yeah I didn't last long with that lol. Also finally updated my first Roblox game, after 11 months. That shitty game I made with my avatars in it that you have to shoot lol. Also I made my college uniform in Roblox, it's pretty good.</p>
    <h1>October 3, 2023</h1>
    <p>The acitivty we had in Java is the hardest so far, and it's the last one. I fucking hate Java, maybe. We ate outside with new friends, almost our whole section. We're only 14 in the section so yeah. Also I played with Mav and Alg with horror games in Roblox. Most of the games suck LMAO. Also when I get asked to read in front, everyone was just fucking laughing at me LOL.</p>

    <h1>October 1, 2023</h1>
    <p>It's October now fellas. I think I'm starting to like Linkin Park now, I got here because of Delfy's outro, and I found "BURN IT DOWN". It's very similar to the outro, and it's fucking good. Also I got my backup files now, I finally got it after days lol. I'm too lazy. Also I'm getting good at emote trimping in Evade, it's fun.</p>
    <h1>September 30, 2023</h1>
    <p>So the "thing" from yesterday is not true, okay then. Also my mom's here now, 3 days training yes. Also I got reminded of "A Serbian Film" again, I watched a recap of it, and yeah. It's probably the most fucked up thing I heard, so far. Also posted a pic of me holding a bottle at both hands, which references to Andy Morin's instagram pics lol.</p>
    <h1>September 29, 2023</h1>
    <p>We watched a thriller movie, and I can't fucking understand most of the dialogue because of my noisy classmates lol. The ending is unexpected damn. Also someone's got a crush on me. It's probably a joke, I hope. I'm not good into that kind of things man. Also Discord this night is getting fucked up lol.</p>
    <h1>September 28, 2023</h1>
    <p>We danced on our PE, after we just practiced for only an hour. I performed pretty good to say the least. Also I bought chicken from the Ministop for the first time. And also we've been followed by Kenshin, our highschool friend. He went to the office too lol. Also Raven, new friend, had a Roblox username with his real name lol.

    <p>So we practiced our Oral Comm and 21st Century things, and the Oral Comm roleplay is thankfully cancelled. Everyone was not ready for that lol. Anyways, we presented our 21st talking shit. I think we're the best one to perform, based on my teacher's rating. She didn't like the whole class' performance tho. Real. Also while I'm in a jeepney, my teacher was there too. And guess what, she's our 21st Century teacher.</p>
    <h1>September 20, 2023</h1>
    <p>We had a club meeting this afternoon today. There's so many students that joined here, probably because of the online game lol. Anyways, we practiced for our Oral Comm roleplay. We didn't use any verbal words during that. It's really hard doing that, but it's fun lol. Also my parents letted an old friend in the house. If I heard correctly, he needs some help. I feel sad for him. Also changed my Discord profile again. Full of ciphers, like I always do.</p>
    <h1>September 19, 2023</h1>

Also I accidentally bled my right hand because I was running, and my sister opened the door. It's not that bad, but it removed my skin. Also posted a meme on my Facebook story. I haven't used that thing in years.</p>

Also my watch's strap got separated in half while in class. How the fuck did it happen. Also in our 21st Century class, we're in the computer lab. I draw shit in the computer, but yeah I'm still listening. It's fun doing that for me actually. Also forgot to mention that I cleaned my twitter tweets yesterday.

    <h1>June 17, 2023</h1>
    <p>Finally, Microsoft Rewards added the Robux option after TWO FUCKING MONTHS. I guess it's worth the wait. Also did a little digging again, but only three times cuz it's hot outside. We also went outside to eat some mixed ice shit, yeah it's a delicacy.</p>

    <h1>June 13, 2023</h1>
    <p>Chaotic day today. The situation about Rom is worse now, parents are needed here in school. They discussed along with my friends who joined the conversation on the "accident" that Lai started. Anyways, me, Kas, Nel, and Lan went to a canteen near the tea shop we're usually in. The chicken there is too much for me lol. Also only payed like 80% to Kas, he gave us free fries lol. Also we migrated to a new fresh gc because of that "accident". A new start eh. Also we got fucking scolded again by our adviser, shit's real bad. Just when we're about to graduate, and things go horribly wrong.</p>

    <h1>June 9, 2023</h1>
    <p>Welp, the sitution with Rom got worse. Our adviser is mad at us again lol. Also Lai and Rom talked with their parents after the "lecturing". Lai apparently started all of this. Luckily I'm not affected, cuz I didn't say shit. Also we thought the leaker of our group chat is Cia, but we're wrong. I hate doing assumptions man. Also we had a dance on PE, and I had no practice cuz I didn't go yesterday. It was literally the same dance again, and it's easy.</p>
    <h1>June 8, 2023</h1>
    <p>Yep, I didn't go to school cuz I got THE FEVER (AYE AYE). But for real I have a flu. I'll try to go to school tomorrow I guess. Also our fucking group chat got leaked. So that's why my alt got kicked hmm (alt purge). I think we're fucked up, or not. Apparently, Rom found our shit, now another reason to hate him.</p>

    <p>Also, another pal is sad again. He also asked me a question what's my motivation in continuing things even though I want to give up. I'm not really into these things, but I answered, because he's my friend. If I could only help him though...</p>
    <h1>January 14, 2023</h1>

Also added "something" in my Discord description. </p>
    <h1>December 15, 2022</h1>

    <p>Finally that guy accepted my friend request on steam, took him like months. I also fried some chicken for lunch. Colored a certain pfp, and it took me many tries :/ . Also got fucking banned from that Discord server from yesterday, and I didn't do anything "bad" yet. Well shit.</p>

    <p>I got 1000 visits on this site and idk why. Still learnin' how to use HTML till now. No school for me this week cuz of a storm. Also I got a time out on some certain Discord server, if you know what I mean. I also unfortunately failed No Bruh November (yes). Why am I doing diary here? Im doing it because I wanna do basic HTML, and share my experience. Also doin' this to improve my English skills.</p>
