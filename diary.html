        <h1>Diary I Wrote</h1>
        <h2>Writing my life, one line at a time, I guess?</h2>
        <h1>December 15, 2024</h1>
        <p>Still extending the music I'm making, it now sounds cooler, hell yeah. Also I really wanna try to lucid dream, so I watched some videos to do that shit. Pretty complicated for the first days, but yeah. Also we have our exams tomorrow, easy.</p>
        <h1>December 14, 2024</h1>
        <p>Woke up late lol, finally, some good sleep. Also finished my Lucie doodle, cool. Also my hair got a fresh today, one of the rare moments I actually remember that I got one lol. Also I'm still continuing the music on Bandlab, it's so good bruh.</p>
        <h1>December 13, 2024</h1>
        <p>It's the presentation of our app and research defense today. Killing two birds with one stone, again. In our app presentation, our teacher suggested that we really should add all the functions that we stated on our research paper. OH MY GOD I'M GONNA SUFFER NEXT SEMESTER I CAN FEEL IT. Anyways, the research defense is pretty easy. Also we went to a game showcase in the school library, IT'S SO COOL. I even found an Undertale reference in of the games LOL. I wanna make a game too m'yeah. Also me and Leo went to buy some fries after that, then it rained. I let him borrow my umbrella, he'll give it to me back on Monday yes. The fries are too salty bruh, too much cheese. Meh, atleast there's ice cream at the office. Also we're stuck at a long traffic going home, bruh.</p>
        <h1>December 12, 2024</h1>
        <p>My attempt for lucid dreaming failed again, I'll just keep trying until I get it. I'll write it here when I do. Also I spent all night finishing this goddamn app, it's our presentation tomorrow. It barely even functions lmao. Also found a new cool band, The Killers. I found them by searching the Death Grips is Online intro sample, it actually sounds cool. Also I made a short music on Bandlab, cool.</p>
        <h1>December 11, 2024</h1>
        <p>My attempt for lucid dreaming this night didn't worked, but I experienced a scary moment. I heard a high pitched sound, I think it's from a phone, idk. I'll try it again tonight. Also I drew Ralsei on Postal Dude's outfit, I experimented in some shading now. Also our schedule for the exams was moved, so there's no classes again tomorrow, probably? Not sure, because they are not announcing anything, but it's likely.</p>
        <h1>December 10, 2024</h1>
        <p>We have our symposium and our final dance presentation for today. We're killing two birds with one stone haha. Also we rented a classroom to practice our symposium, and they didn't even cleaned it after. Goddamn it. Also me an my mom bought some white shoes for the dance. Hell yeah. Also we waited for a long time for our dance, my classmates asked that we should be first so my section can finish the symposium in time. We got placed near the last to perform. What the fuck. So we rushed to school after we performed. We look so messy while presenting, but the judges congratulated us. Wholesome moment. Also we helped our other classmates to bring the dresses. After we got there, they said that there's two stuff missing. But actually, first one was miscounted, so it's good now, and the last one was taken by Leo. He rushed to get it lol. I also feel sick today after all of that shit. And there's still the app I still need to do. FUUUUUCK. Also I will try to lucid dream tonight, yes.</p>
        <h1>December 9, 2024</h1>
        <p>Tried out the new speakers my mom apparently bought for me lol, I didn't even requested it. It has bluetooth so it's easy to set up. We also took our last practice for our dance tomorrow today. It was so fun. Also watched a Geometry Dash movie with Leo in his house, it's inside the game btw. It's so peak. Also we talked about the PvZ Heroes update, it got updated after years.</p>
        <h1>December 8, 2024</h1>

        <p>I had a dream that I found a Ralsei plush just in our house, and I woke up. Man life is so disappointing ;-;. Also my back fucking hurts today, probably because I didn't did a warm up yesterday before we practiced lol.</p>
        <h1>December 3, 2024</h1>
        <p>Only two classes for today, some of my classmates did not attend, as usual. Also I thought we can practice in the capital now, turns out we can't. Oh my god, I gotta go to that place again. Also I heard that one of our classmate got in a vehicle accident, so that's why he's not here. Also I think he's the only one not in the dance currently, because everyone is here. The dance practice is so fun even though we always get scolded LMAO.

No classes, aight. Also I though we're gonna get home now, but we still got some research stuff to do. Leo was pissed off that morning because of it. We still gotta have to get it signed to three people. And it still has some minor mistakes on it, even though it's the third revision. What the fuck. Also I made a Half-Life 2 workshop mod, replacing the pistol sounds with kitchen gun. Gotta be the first one to do it.</p>

Also someone is taunting me after kill in TF2 as a sniper, I play sniper too. He dueled me, and I got a 5 - 0 score, I'm the 5 scoring one. He still acts nice though, gotta respect him for that.

Oh and I tried PvZ heroes too, pretty fun. Also we had a PE practice in SM, I act as the girl cause there's no more female partners. It's aight. Also I think Ralph blocked me, probably because of what I did to him in the practice. I did some fake high-fives, I don't know if that's the case. I felt bad.</p>

        <p>We practiced our dance performance for our live activity, but it got rescheduled to thursday, and then again to tomorrow. Honestly, I like it for tomorrow than thursday, so there's no more classes for thursday. We just recorded two of our dances because of that, still, it's worth it. Also Leo's mom went in the office while I'm in there, it's still about the scholarship thingy. Also I'm drawing a fanart of Vicmiaou for his bday, he's just a random internet stranger that I met, still one of my few online friends.</p>
        <h1>October 7, 2024</h1>
        <p>We have a research defense today, and we're not fucking ready. Oh well, the show must go on. And what the saying is actually true, we suffer more in our imaginations. It's not that bad actually. There's mistakes, but it can be fixed too. After that, me and Leo went outside to buy some shit. We actually wanna buy some ice cream, but the shop is closed. So I went home early. Also I finished a cool au art, I half regret posting it online, cuh. And from this moment, I realize, that I should not give a swag. Peak cinema fr fr.</p>

        <p>I went to school today, and what I said yesterday was worth it. I wore a mask of a One Direction member, and that band is loved by our club teacher. It's pretty funny doing that. Also after that, me and Leo printed 130 copies of the two comics, the other one including mine. Well, we didn't actually printed 130 exactly, we printed 17 copies more because of some errors or shit. Luckily we counted it. Also we ate at the funny scoops & savoury place, I'm still hungry. Also I did a cursed Ralsei outfit in Roblox, it's pretty accurate to the game lmao. </p>

        <p>Leo got a new facial shave, he looks like markiplier lmao. Anyways, the comic I did actually got accepted, I didn't expected it to be because of the dialogue. It is what it is I guess. Also Juniel talked about the Drake lore in the school while waiting for Leo, it took us a long time. The lore is so deep that it's so interesting. Also we're supposed to get some ice cream, but the place ran out of it. Damn.</p>

Anyways, I shared to Leo the "comic" I found yesterday,he actually wants to see it huh. Also I "beated" "it" again, I think it's starting to become a habit now. Holy shit, what they're saying is actually real XD. Also Leo rode with me in the jeepney, he's going to come with his mother in the complex.

It got me confused, then I saw it was a funeral delivery. I don't mean to disrespect them, but come on, it's causing a traffic. I kinda don't like that tradition. Anyways, the group meeting is fun. Leo even printed a face of Sir Miko, it's so goofy. Also we standed up in front with a group of friend to introduce ourselves lol. And after the meeting finished, I just stayed at the office.

Also I struggled with the coding that afternoon, I can't figure how to print an html thing multiple times using js. Holy shit.

Oh and we interviewed a dying rat in the streets, I made it into a shitpost LMAO. Also my parents went somewhere this night, they're going to be here late.

Oh and I just walked it from the school, it's about 15 minutes before I could get there. And I had to do that 4 times, because I ate lunch the office. Took us many tries to finish our dance, and there are still some mistakes left there lol. Welp, it is what it is. Also I watched the our group where Leo is there, and he stole my santa hat while he's at it. Oh and I started to draw an avatar of a member of my Roblox group, gotta practice it somehow.</p>

She said she got tricked after she realized that it's only the Solar System lol. Also I downloaded the "Top 10000 Cheese" that Leo mentioned earlier for the funny LMAO. Also he asked me for some help with a code that I passed on paper. When I actually tried it on an online compiler, it has so many errors. I just putted some little fixes and it works now.</p>

        <p>My mom bought some empanada for dinner, it's mid. Not my type. Also drew Ralsei again in full form, I have lowered the size of my canva, because it's much easier to do and it's unique for my art style.</p>

        <p>I think Lei saw this file last night, I hope he doesn't mind that. We went to a trip with mah cousins to a local waterfall tourist spot. Trekking down there is easy, but when we went up it's to fucking exhausting. My sister is the most tired one lol. Oh and we swam at the bottom of the falls, it's so cold there. I even climbed a rock there, it's fun. Also our tour guide is pretty chill, I like him. Also I posted a story in Facebook with the pictures I taken there, and 90% of the story is just dump memes. I don't give a swag. Oh and my cousins will leave now early tomorrow morning, it's been fun gg.</p>
        <h1>August 24, 2024</h1>
        <p>My cousins went here both from my mother and my father's side. It's to celebrate our mother's birthday. We went to a long walk to the farms again. It's quite refreshing walking there. They're fun to hang out with. I played overtime this night lol.</p>
        <h1>August 23, 2024</h1>

The classes of schools are also suspended because of some volcanic ash spreading at the area. So I saw all of my siblings at the office that noon. Me and my brother also try going home, but there's so many passengers, so we just went back to the office lol. Oh and we played Roblox there, added my sister's old alt account.

        <h1>June 29, 2024</h1>
        <p>Last night, our puppy is feeling sick. He's too fucking active and he bumped his head on a door. That's probably why he's sick. Also I drank with my parents last night. It's just flavored beer so not too strong. And for today, the dog's feeling a bit better now. My mom gave him porkchop for dinner while we just ate fried eggs. What a funny spoiled dog. Oh and I finished part 2 of my drawing series, it's berdly in an AU. Imma try to do some of the characters. Oh and I made the berdly one with some cipher, and it leads to a stick bug video for the funnies. And lastly, I found a dead kitten in the canals.

        <p>There's an event in our covered court. It's a sportsfest of our place. They shown the muses first before the event lol. Yeah I watched it in a moment. Also my mouse is acting up again, can't even play normally cuz of that. I really need to buy a new one.</p>
        <h1>June 22, 2024</h1>
        <p>Found out about Xiu Xiu today, I got interested because of the one interesting album cover of them. I started at their first album, and holy shit it's so experimental. It's like Death Grips all over again, but more depressing. Also I'm pissing twice again at night, oh my god it's back again.</p>
        <h1>June 21, 2024</h1>
        <p>Leo streamed again this morning, he'll probably have that schedule on other days. Also my brother found a broken plate in the kitchen, I wonder who did that in the three of us lol. Also I washed the clothes remaining in the washer without my dad telling me. Gotta help them a little bit.</p>
        <h1>June 20, 2024</h1>
        <p>Last day of exams, and it's pretty easy (it's easy this time). Also after the exams are done, Leo took my bag while I'm doing something lol. He passed it to another friend mine, and he fucking stalled me lmao. I catched up to him later, and we did some last chit-chatting with Charles. He bought some donuts, cool. Also Vippy finally realized that I'm a Filipino. LMAO. Also btw, I'm always one of the first ones to finish all those exams, cool.</p>
        <h1>June 19, 2024</h1>
        <p>My parents are now telling me to find a part-time job this summer. I now got struck by reality. Welp, gotta prepare now. Also me and Leo played GMOD and mess around with the Media Player. The videos that played are so funny.</p>
        <h1>June 18, 2024</h1>
        <p>Second day of exam, and it's pretty easy (to fail). Also Leo trolled me with a fucking corn tube while inside the room. What a piece of shit, yeah that's what I call him that lmao. Also they went to Sir Miko again to recite the preamble, and hell naw they're in a meeting again. Guess they'll do it in Thursday, the last damn day. Also I delivered some candies that my mom gave to Rey, our school maintenance keeper. It was raining and the door's locked in the building, so another teacher called him so I could gave it lol. Also I guessed Jairus' album early access password lol. I get to listen to it early, and honestly it's not that bad. Also Leo edited a GD icon to be Perell Brown, if ya know that guy. It's so fucking stupid LMAO.</p>
        <h1>June 17, 2024</h1>
        <p>I've been waking up late in the past two days, probably because I slept late I guess. Also I dreamed a TF2 gameplay, and it fucking sucks lmao. Can't even control it. And it was on pl_badwater, I still remember it cuz it's the scene before I woke up. Truly the dream of all time. Also I've noticed that I've been washing so many dishes this week, what's happening bruv.</p>
        <h1>June 16, 2024</h1>
        <p>I watched Leo's stream last night, I forgot to write it lol. Also it's Fathers' Day today, hell yeah. So relatives went here tonight. They stayed here until 10PM. Also Kurt asked me to do their SHS shirt, it looks accurate I guess. And Pork is now asking me to draw his avatars now, jsut remember I only do it if I wanna. But I'll do it anyways. Also Ken asked me to do something homeroom related, I'm happy to help.</p>
        <h1>June 15, 2024</h1>
        <p>Dad came to pick up my mom today, with my sister included in the trip. Also I'm playing TF2 as a yeti with a shotgun, best cosplay ever. And I'm playing late at night waiting for them.</p>
        <h1>June 14, 2024</h1>
        <p>We have three exams today. Science, KOMFIL, and Math. Math is obviously the hardest one here, I don't even have any answers on the last part lol. Also I have to go early to school to recite the preamble, and I only stuttered once. Sir really didn't forgot about the recitation huh. Also Jairus took a pic of me and turned it into the Exmilitary album. He still likes Death Grips huh. I'm not listening to Death Grips that much now. I'm in my metalcore era (cool). Also I finished Entropy Zero 2, and goddamn that game is so cool. And apparently there's multiple endings, so imma try to get that someday. Also we did R/fiftyfifty while waiting after class for reciting the preamble. It was strangely addicting, especially with friends.</p>
        <h1>June 13, 2024</h1>
        <p>Our puppy is so fucking hyperactive, he's been biting my pants. Also cooked some noodles this afternoon, we really finished those three packs of noodles huh.

        <p>Woke up early this morning, too excited I guess. Also Pork added three extra alts on my group lmao, it's only him lol. Also my ILS group went here to record our news reporting. We finished it today, hell yeah. Also they stayed for some time after we finished it upstairs. The air conditioner is probably tired now lol. Also I rejected the money that Charles will give me, because I did the app by myself. It's just free, just the cost of my insanity. Also I don't even know what to use that money for. Also tried to mashup BMTH Lost and I'm Not Okay by MCR. It actually sounds fitting. Also left a message without any context in the Roblox Deltarune group lmao.</p>
        <h1>June 11, 2024</h1>
        <p>We have few more classes to go today, one starts at 8:30. Also Sir Miko did one final activity in our last class at him in UCSP. We're supposed to be trio, but Raven is absent. So we did the activity with only Leo. And guess what, we won it lmao. We're not the first one to finish it, but we are the first one to answer perfectly. We're the only duo, and we didn't expect to win. We got a delicious choco bar each. Very worth it. We also took one final class pic there, apparently Sir Miko is going to go back to our high school to teach. I'll miss him. Also fixed the Roblox shirts from yesterday, it's definitely better now. I really should stop wasting Robux amirite. Also my mom is going to Thailand tomorrow, she's getting ready this night. I hope she have a safe travel.</p>

Also my mum had some visitors, and it's our brgy. captain, again. Cool I guess? Also I finally finished the app, kinda. I only did three functions cuz the others are complicated. Finally my suffering in that app is done. Hope our presentation will go well tomorrow. Also helped Dani to finish the presentation too, stayed up until 10PM. Also the visitors are still here at that time.</p>
        <h1>June 8, 2024</h1>
        <p>Dad cooked some coffee jelly for the first time again. I haven't eaten those for quite some time now. Also my dad let me ride his motorcycle again to buy stuff. My mom gave me a large bill to use, holy shit.</p>
        <h1>June 7, 2024</h1>
        <p>We had a sock race for PE, and it's very easy lmao. Ya just have to record it and there's no race. Also when I went to "The Crunch" to eat, I met Don on the way. He told me a nasty story lmao. He followed me there to wait for someone. Also Marcus was there to buy too, cool. Also after that, I went straight to the room now. Yeah the office was not available that time. After the first subject was ended, I noticed that Leo was still not here. I asked Ralph about that, and he said he's on a computer shop to do some shit for their ILS. And he went home lol. Also almost the whole class didn't attend the math lesson because of the Research shit. We're only about nine students there lol. Also I found a mogu-mogu drink on a chair. I asked the room, and no one claimed it. Might aswell drink it, not gonna waste any shit. And I shouldn't have done that lol. Apparently it's Angel's drink, and I went to a 7-11 store to buy one to replace it. I didn't have the courage to ask her if it's her drink. So I just drank the thing again going home. I'm not going to forget about this shit lmao.</p>
        <h1>June 6, 2024</h1>
        <p>We only had two classes today, and most of our classmate are absent. Guess they got lazy today. Also it rained tonight, the rainy season is near. Also I installed the Geometry Dash series again on mobile, I miss those levels.</p>

Also our puppy is so playful now that he even bites the mop while I'm mopping. Also TF2 fans are now protesting today, they review bombed TF2 to death lol. I hope valve really fixes TF2 this time.</p>
        <h1>June 3, 2024</h1>
        <p>Boring ahh morning class, and we didn't had comlab. Damn it. Also my dad went there for a bit just to observe our teacher lmao. Also we had a research recitation this afternoon, and I didn't review as always. My classmates did though, good for them. About the recitation, I was the first one to get called, and I got the correct answer at my first try. My luck is so good. Also we took a class pic in our R&W subject, my funny hand gesture was not shown unfortunately, the bags are obscuring the view. Also there's some fiesta going on after class at the road, the traffic was a bit long. And we don't have classes tomorrrow, also my parents too. Cool, I have more time working at the app, I hope.</p>
        <h1>June 2, 2024</h1>

Also my national id is now here, and I know what I have to do. I tried age verifying my account on roblox on the first tries, but it didn't work. Got it after some tries. Finally. Also this week's another hell week. So many fucking things to do. We'll get this over eventually.</p>
        <h1>May 31, 2024</h1>
        <p>I went to PE class even though we have no teacher currently. I thought we're going to continue our PE activity, but nah. My trip there was nothing. I just ate some chicken again at "The Crunch" for lunch. Speaking of it, I ate one too for the first time yesterday, the chicken was so good. Also we changed room in our math class, k. Oh and I commuted after the class and I finally experienced it. It's only just this time so why not. Also we went to McDonalds to celebrate my sister's graduation. She's top 1 in the elementary school I went to.</p>
        <h1>May 30, 2024</h1>
        <p>My stomach hurts from eating the fried egg that morning lol, just gotta "release" it. Anyways, first subject was boring this Thursday, as usual. Me and Leo login our steam account at the school computer lmao. We look at each others account, and he added Lukas because he saw my friends list. Also our Research class was replaced with the Science one. A classmate thought that our adviser hates us lol. Also my mother had a long meeting after class, so I just bought some siomai rice outside. Oh yeah, I got interviwed too for Toby's survey. Gotta help a friend too. Also I finally know why Pork was inactive for some days now, I hope he's alright. Also procrastinated a hell again this night, and I finally "completed" the performance task activity involving a certain app with a database. All thanks for Jillian's work lol.</p>
        <h1>May 29, 2024</h1>
        <p>I'm playing TF2 again for the past days, it's getting back on me again. Also I started talking at my Roblox groups again, I'm feeling better now. Also I tried doing our app on Android Studio, and holy hell it was painful to use and learn. I can't do that alone man.</p>
        <h1>May 28, 2024</h1>
        <p>We have no science class today, cuz apparently our teacher was sick. Alright. Also my computer was fixed now, so it's fucking fast again, hell yeah. Also Leo keeps slapping me in my arm, so I slapped his arm too. And then he slapped me again, what the fuck. His reason is karma lmao. Yeah it's a joke. Oh also to add, my dad cooked some good chicken with gravy tonight. I asked some fried chicken that morning and it's actually for my sister's party. The chicken was so good.</p>

It was a pretty boring day. And this night there's still no electricity, but my dad has some spare batteries for some lights. Also I have to wash the dishes "manually" without the faucet.</p>
        <h1>May 25, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finally got the accessories from the classic event on Roblox. It sucks, just like the hunt event last time. But thankfully it's not that grindy. Also my Spotify liked songs are back, probably just a bug after I reinstall spotify. Also added Berdly on that said drawing, epic lore. Also BMTH released their new album yesterday, I only liked two new songs on that album honestly. Anyways those are bangers. Also I copied someone's avatar at Booth Game in Roblox lmao. I'm his doppelganger. Also Raven joined me in that game for a short while just to say he has to shit. Ok. Also there's a typhoon in our country right now. Oh it's going to rain for a couple of days.</p>

Also I finally won the murder mystery game at my second try today. I got a funny car keychain that flashes light, cool. Also Dustine and Jayver is here again, I really miss them. Also we did some videoke this afternoon. I was screaming and shit LOL. Also I decided to wait for the awarding to end, and I didn't expect it to be THAT long. I bought some fries and waited there.

        <h1>May 23, 2024</h1>
        <p>We have a youth fest convention for today and tomorrow. Also I walked to the mall after my fare this morning. I'm too early, so why not try to walk to it. I'm never walking at that left side again, vehicles are facing me lol. I waited outside after that for a bit. At the mall, there's many booths that are displayed and some event at the stage. We just goofed off after we signed up at the attendance. Little did we know we had to go to every booth and sign for an attendace. It was a painful task. Also Jayver came here to visit us. We did some window shopping lmao. Oh and we didn't get to sing at the videoke, so many people eugh. I also forgot Leo puts something at my bag, and I forgot it when we are leaving. Also I added message at Hima's website with the Story of Undertale hyperlink lmao. Also found another good album, and it's post-hardcore, hell yeah. Also added another one for another character to the drawing I'm currently making. I'm probably gonna be repeating this for a couple of days.</p>

        <p>My parents adjusted so I can go to school early. We only have one class for today at 8 AM. Pretty cool. Also after the class, my ILS groupmates tried to record some lines for the radio shit. We only recorded 3 lines LMAO, the room is only available until 12 PM unfortunately. Also drawn a pretty cool Deltarune AU art. I'm more amazed at the colors I picked, it really fits the white background, and the dark and gritty nature of it. The thing I've been drawing is inspired by the song Wurst Vacation, my favorite Ice Nine Kills song. Pretty cool. Hol up I already said "pretty cool" two times lol.</p>
        <h1>May 20, 2024</h1>
        <p>Probably the most tiring and unluckiest day for me so far. Got hit by a tricycle while I'm in the fucking pedestrian lane. I really hate this country. Also I surveyed some students too, and I got surveyed too. The questions was complicated lol. Also my mom went to my sister's graduation ceremony so we have to wait at the school to get us picked up with my dad. There's too many people at the public transportation at that time. Another reason to hate this shit country. And to top all of that, my fucking new computer broke. I gotta downgrade again while my dad fixes it. Oh my god. Also I'm up until 11 PM again because of the stupid fucking science activity we have. It's the DNA shit and I have to write all of it.</p>
        <h1>May 19, 2024</h1>

        <h1>May 18, 2024</h1>
        <p>My ILS group mates went to our house to record the radio drama script. And unfortunately, the fucking microphone broke. Damn it, we're going to continue it on Tuesday I guess. They also ate here too so their time is not wasted.</p>
        <h1>May 17, 2024</h1>
        <p>I've been remaking our old Geometry Dash collab level. I am so back in my GD era. Also in our PE class, we played chess. It's intense playing in a 5 minute timer each lol. Also I bought some chop suey for our lunch, and it's worth the wait. Also while we're on our way home, I saw a fucked up body of a cat I assume at the highway, it got ran over. Life sucks. Oh and Raven finally went to school after weeks. It's weird seeing him after some time lol.</p>
        <h1>May 16, 2024</h1>
        <p>Forgot to mention that my motherboard yesterday broke, there's a replacement for it though fortunately. My dad brought my brother in a car this morning, and I got left. My mother told me I don't need it. Dang it lmao. Anyways, the room is so fucking cold that morning. Idk why. Also we did some survey shit again, and we got 16 so far.

        <h1>May 15, 2024</h1>
        <p>Was just chillin' in the house and suddenly I need to go to school for a survey. Lmao. Anyways, we only surveyed 3 people today, is it worth it? No. But at least we have some progress. Also I noticed that some of my Spotify liked songs was gone, what the fuck. Oh and procrastinating some shit again tonight, what a surprise.</p>
        <h1>May 14, 2024</h1>
        <p>It fucking rained while I'm on my way to school, my pants are wet and it's cold. It's only for a while though, it eventually stopped. Also we adopted a puppy from Wacky, she has eight puppies, and we have to adopt one. The puppy was cute :D. Also we changed room for our Science class this afternoon, and we continue our classes in that room. Oh and I have a new computer now, so I could run Android Studio. It has 16 GB of ram, heck yeah.</p>
        <h1>May 13, 2024</h1>
        <p>First subject is boring again, as usual. And when we went to our comlab, my pc was fucking broken. Had to use another pc at my left because I don't have anything to use. Also I've been binge watching Joeseppi for two days now. His videos are cool check it out.</p>
        <h1>May 12, 2024</h1>
        <p>Tbh, the resort we went to today was not that worth it. If the water was just a bit warmer, we might swim again. We only swam 1 time though. And the rest of that was waiting in our room, and my fucking phone is on low battery. Great. Also I got scolded this night for putting too much salt on a plate, like what the fuck Dad you didn't even said how much salt to put. I'm a bit sad and angry at that. Man, life sucks. Oh and Leo was just pinging at me this night, he just spammin' shit LMAO.</p>
        <h1>May 11, 2024</h1>

        <h1>May 9, 2024</h1>
        <p>I can finally revert the Roblox pose of my avatar to the classic one. Rare Roblox w update. Eh, also I didn't go to our sportsfest this day, and also for tomorrow. I lost my motivation to go because of what happened yesterday. Oh and I accidentally added Haven in Facebook lol, hope he's not bothered by that. Also someone followed me on Roblox, I looked at her profile and she have one my closed game favorited. Uhm what, oh and she friend requested me too if that isn't weird. Also I finally took a very short nap this afternoon lol, feeling very tired.</p>
        <h1>May 8, 2024</h1>
        <p>I didn't get to play scrabble this day because they fucking changed the schedule early this morning, and I'm fucking asleep. I've wasted my time going there, so I just watched them play. I'm pretty disappointed. Just stayed at the office for a bit then my dad brought me home because he got something to do at another place.</p>
        <h1>May 7, 2024</h1>
        <p>We had a spelling bee this morning. I really underestimated that contest, I only got six points in total lol. Leo won that, not suprised, he's so good man. Also that afternoon, I played the fucking annoying violin music with Leo and Juniel. We played it at the same time and they got annoyed as expected. Also, I've been looking at my youtube subscriptions this night, and oh my god, it's been a long time since I seen some of them. I feel really sad about the inactive youtubers I've watched a long time ago. Man... Oh and drawn my avatar, again, for something. Also Leo's friend Kre asked us we want to pretend to be a high schooler while we're buying shit at the store, she didn't even gave us a context lmao.</p>
        <h1>May 6, 2024</h1>
        <p>Raven is still not here, still haven't seen him for two weeks. He's still active online tho. Also we had the most boring Research lecture this afternoon lol, almost everyone looks sleepy. Also I've been procrastinating the hell out this night, fucking hell. Yeah also we ate at the Ministop again after months with Juniel. It's pretty nostalgic there, eating the chocolate bread again feels nice.</p>

Also my parents are going to a vacation tomorrow, and we're alone again in the house.</p>
        <h1>May 2, 2024</h1>

        <p>Tried to redemeed the Roblox code, and it didn't even add up. Probably tomorrow it will work, I hope. Also I'm getting back in my golden age era of music. Error37 and Death Grips with a mix of Ice Nine Kills. Also I've been sending some Yakuza gifs at our server, I'm not a fan of it, but it looks funny. <br> P.S. The code worked now at 8:30 PM, how the fuck did Roblox took that long to do it.  <br> P.S. P.S. Nvm it fucking dipped again what the fuck.</p>
        <h1>April 28, 2024</h1>
        <p>Watched a movie about a dog last night, but only the last part, movie's called Arthur the King. Ending's good too I guess. Also watched an alien movie too, and I'm at the middle when I watched it with my mother this afternoon. That movie is cool, it's called Proximity. Also oh my god we don't have any classes again until Wednesday. Fuck you heat.</p>
        <h1>April 27, 2024</h1>
        <p>My mom tried to make me clean the fucking canals again, but I delayed and it's hot now. She made me wash the clothes then. Also a tall barrier is now added at the door to our other garage. This is to prevent the cats to go in, but they still did it lol. Also I've been watching a series of Half-Life 2 blind playthrough. It's infuriating watching her play the game, as a "professional gamer".</p>
        <h1>April 26, 2024</h1>
        <p>The loud kitty was now adopted by a random kid. I'll probably miss him, well to be honest I miss that kitty now. He's full fleas though, so it's ok lol. Also my Dad cooked a delicious pork meat stew, so good. Also the table's flipped back to normal now, I can finally hug the wall again! Also my parents didn't go to work today, k. Also cleaned up the canals in our left part of the house, my mom really loves canals. I also found a fucking cockroach in the toilet, didn't flush it though, idk.</p>
        <h1>April 25, 2024</h1>
        <p>Goddamn why the fuck is it so hot this month. I've been suffering for weeks because of this fucking temperature. Anyways, finally finished the darn math assingment, even though I know I'm wrong with that. I'm super late at that assignment. Also grinded 500 survivals in Midnight Horrors to get the funny bat. Also I just found out that you can change group owners in Roblox, so I did that to test the discount shit that Roblox haven't patched yet. Good. Also I just met JM again after years in our house. He was borrowing my pants lol.</p>
        <h1>April 24, 2024</h1>
        <p>I've been doin's my assignment this night and suddenly my class gc is in chaos. We got no classes until Friday, which is confirmed by my mother. Ok. Also drawn my avatar in Roblox again, for the group icon. Imma draw egg A.K.A. pork next. Also played the Minimalist mod of Half-Life 2 Beta, and it fucking sucks, in a good way. It's funny lol. Oh and I speedran Highway 17 in Half-Life 2 with the bhop glitch backwards. It was fun doing that.</p>
        <h1>April 23, 2024</h1>
        <p>We finally finished our UCSP presentation, and got 97, ok then. Also it looks like we got forced into a sports festival, fuck it. Also I finished Amalgam tonight, it was fun and short.</p>
        <h1>April 22, 2024</h1>
        <p>Welp, the computers on the computer lab got shuffled, so we didn't have any com lab today. Oh my god, the only time where it's actually interesting. Also I looked at my Google Photos again, and I found some funny old family videos. I sent it to our family group chat cuz why not.</p>
        <h1>April 21, 2024</h1>
        <p>Played Amalgam again, and I didn't expect it to be that scary. A dark and griddy game I'll say. Also finished that Half-Life iceberg today and the two hour watch was totally worth it. Also two kids threw a rock to get some mangoes near a tree, but it hit our roof. My dad scolded them lmao.</p>
        <h1>April 20, 2024</h1>
        <p>My parents went to fix the car scrape outside, and it's good now. Also we had "Halo-halo" this afternoon, and it's actually better than the one we ordered last time. Also I'm the one who cooked our dinner this night because my parents are busy singing, ehh. Also we have a new food table now, pretty big. Oh so it's my parents' anniversary today, cuh.</p>
        <h1>April 19, 2024</h1>
        <p>We fucked up in our P.E. class today. We skipped shit and we had to do it again next week. As I said, it is what it is. Also the UCSP presentation we supposed to have was out of time so we're going to present next week. Also most of us was absent this afternoon after that, we're only about 25 in class lol, but atleast the last two subjects was fun. Also Team Fortress 2 was updated to 64-bit today. Finally a true major update. There's also a black bird that was found in the classroom this afternooon, how the fuck.</p>
        <h1>April 18, 2024</h1>
        <p>What a unusual day to start school, god. The building we're supposed to be in was only opened at 7:00 AM, which is the start of our class. And while waiting, somebody fainted on the sidewalk and she was brought to the clinic. What the fuck, this day is cursed. Speaking of this day, we supposed to have "no classes", but it is what it is. Also met Jay again while I'm buying my lunch, pretty chill friend. Oh and also we didn't have our last afternoon class, because she doesn't have anymore lesson to teach this week, or she's just lazy, probably. I also downloaded Half-Life 2 on the school computer, this is pretty epic.</p>
        <h1>April 17, 2024</h1>
        <p>Last exam day, and it's pretty easy. Also my mom's car got damaged in the garage, what a unfortunate moment. Oh yeah also there's my first member on my Roblox group, and it's Pork's alt.Changed the group photo to resemble his avatar lol.</p>
        <h1>April 16, 2024</h1>
        <p>Exams again. Yes I don't review shit. Also I bought some cold ice tea drink while waiting to get into my mom's office because there's too many people waiting at the cashier. I hate being an introvert sometimes. Also it looks like I'm becoming interested at Ice Nine Kills today, watched some of their music videos. Cool.</p>
        <h1>April 15, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finally saw the kittens, she had two actually. The kittens were transferred to a box so it's much more comfortable. Also I got to play Evade Testing again, for the third time. Cool amiright.</p>
        <h1>April 14, 2024</h1>
        <p>We have a container full of fucking smelly fish that was brought here. The smell can me smelled outside the refrigirator. God damn it stinks. Atleast it's delicous though. Also played Free Draw on Roblox, drawn Freeman and Spamton right there. Also my mother forced us to come with her to buy some stuff at the nearby stores. Alright then.</p>
        <h1>April 13, 2024</h1>
        <p>Haven't seen Matian's kitty yet, she hided it that's why. Also drawn a new profile picture for my Facebook. It still has the christmas hat lol. Also it looks like I'm going back to my metal era in early 2023. Thanks to Ice Nine Kills and Linkin Park. Oh yeah also Linkin Park's Reanimation album is so good. </p>
        <h1>April 12, 2024</h1>
        <p>Our cat, Matian, gave birth to a kitten. Oh my god there's so much cats in our house now. Also Leo and Denver have birthdays today. They better be oiled up. Also my brother forgot his green case so I brought it to school. And he didn't even used it, what the fuck. Also took three tests today, Science, Fil, and Math. I did that without reviewing. Time to fail I guess. Oh and I played Half-Life 1 in my phone. It's painful setting it up, but it works now.</p>
        <h1>April 11, 2024</h1>
        <p>So yeah we presented our Research titles this afternoon. I was pretty chill during that, and it's worth it. Yep, the first one got accepted. Anyways, the other ICT section boys interrogated me in the waiting room before the presentation happened. I shouted for fucking help, in a joke way. Also stayed in Charles' house with my other groupmates to discuss it. Also a guy called me a tryhard while playing the zombie game I've been playing in Roblox. I just kept saying "sorry" just to troll him. Worth it. Oh yeah also met Jairus again. As usual, he spoke to me for a while.What I mean for a while is minutes. Also I'm liking The Hunting Party album of Linkin Park. They are metal again in that era. Also finished watching the Half-life VR series, it's so peak.</p>
        <h1>April 10, 2024</h1>
        <p>They're here now this afternoon, nice. Also we've been rushing our research titles today, and I hope they're good. Oh and the right part of my headphones is dismantled so now I have to use my mom's earphones. Goddamnit. Also we had one final meeting again, goodluck to us tomorrow I guess. Also Julian is now in our Discord server, finally.</p>
        <h1>April 9, 2024</h1>
        <p>Yep, only my brother and I were here in the house. He's a pain in the ass, kinda. Oh yea also there's a new rice cooker that my mom bought just for two days. Worth it. Also we have a Discord meeting for our Research presention this upcoming Thursday, okay.</p>
        <h1>April 8, 2024</h1>
        <p>An old elementary classmate of mine came with me in the car to go to school. Ok, I don't interact that much with her anyways. Also I waited so much outside because I'm so early. So I bought some snacks because of that. Oh and we got an early dismissal this afternoon. We're supposed to be here until 4PM, and that fucking sucks. Anyways, posted a picture of Gaster as a water dispenser. Comically funny. Also I'm noticing our Roblox group is getting dry, gotta try to restore it by my will I guess. Also I've been watching the Half-Life VR but the AI is Self-Aware series, and I gotta say it's fucking peak. Also my parents and my sister is going now this early morning. I hope they're safe in their trip.</p>
        <h1>April 7, 2024</h1>
        <p>So I decided not to come with my parents on the trip on Tuesday to Wednesday. I'll be here in the house with mah brother. Also noticed that the orange cat we adopted is no longer here, may she be safe out there, I hope. Also installed Black Mesa in my pc even though I know it won't run good. I'mma try to finish it, it's so good.</p>
        <h1>April 6, 2024</h1>
        <p>Finally got a horse in our Minecraft world. Also a sibling of my friend destroyed some of the things we did there, he even stole some stuff too lol. Also watched a video of someone saving some Half-Life 1 scientists, this made me interested in playing Half-Life again.</p>
        <h1>April 5, 2024</h1>
        <p>It's Friday again, eugh. Anyways, in our PE class, we did the table tennis again. We only had 1 minute to record our session and it sucks. Guess we'll fail. Also we have a new Minecraft world again, and I got full diamond armor. I'm lucky this time. Also my parents said we're going on a trip next week, god dang it I hate trips.</p>
        <h1>April 4, 2024</h1>
        <p>So I got lucky when I woke up late. There's a tricyle while I'm waiting, and I very rarely got to ride on of those to school. I think the last I rode is when I'm in 7th grade, damn. Also didn't expect that our PR quiz to be that hard. I just gave up after answering the easy questions lol. Also brought some crayons for our R&W subject, and I just drawn a corn and ice drink. Goofy. Also my throat is still sick until rn, eh. Oh yeah also got into a hot fight in a quiz game by group. So there are four groups and we're losing, so we used our special cards to slow down the winning group. It was funny.</p>
        <h1>April 3, 2024</h1>
        <p>Played Minecraft with some friends tonight. Xen already got to the nether :skull:. And yeah, adjusted some things in mah website. That's about it for today.</p>
        <h1>April 2, 2024</h1>
        <p>Feeling a little bit sick today, it's mainly my throat. Fuck I really need to sleep early. Also I finished the website overhaul now, I understand the code of my website again lol. Also the Roblox games with the April fool's theme is so fucking funny. Evade also has a really good mission with that. Also damn you Youtube for making my latest video a fucking shorts, I really hate that.</p>
        <h1>April 1, 2024</h1>
        <p>April fools day or whatever, I'm not that gullible today (real). Also my stomach hurts while in school, so I did what's the most logical thing to do. Yep. Also our ICT presentation was moved to Thursday, great. Also Leo stayed in the office for a while because he's waiting for something. Also I'm working on the new website design again tonight. Much cleaner code probably.</p>
        <h1>March 31, 2024</h1>
        <p>Oh yeah in the past two days, me and my siblings have been checking on our old drawings like the good old times. We even found the funny puzzle piece with a bunch of absurd drawings on it lol. Anyways, yeah I already knew that we're gonna do our three man presentation tomorrow this Sunday night. Porkastination. Also we didn't go to church today, weird huh. Oh and it's gonna be April 1 tomorrow, with classes, get real. Also working on my website overhaul again tonight, I might change it soon.</p>
        <h1>March 30, 2024</h1>
        <p>Bought some ice cream for our snack this afternoon cuz it's hot. Well not an ice cream but a popsicle. They don't have any stock of ice cream rn. Also discovered a good roblox game again. It takes me back to the good old days of roblox, even though I haven't experienced it lol.</p>
        <h1>March 29, 2024</h1>
        <p>Met Vippy in a Midnight Horrors match. It was surreal seeing them in there. Also not that much happened today, meh.</p>
        <h1>March 28, 2024</h1>
        <p>Because I don't have anything good to do, I 100% the event. The remaining events was not that bad. Luckily my siblings played DOORS with me this morning. Finally got the badge there. Also it looks like the two kittens are going to stay here. Damn we already have so many cats in the house. Also discovered a good Linkin Park song again, and it's in the Hybrid Theory album ofcourse. It's one of the most underrated songs in the album. Also created a Roblox group for me, 100 robux down the drain I guess.</p>
        <h1>March 27, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finally finished the hunt today. Is it really worth it? Not really. Good riddance I don't have to play anymore brainrot games. Found a few fun one though. Also it's a bit hot today, damn you sun.</p>
        <h1>March 26, 2024</h1>
        <p>There's two stray kittens that went to our other garage today. Those two kittens were brave for their age, even though our cats were angry at them. One kitty was orange, she looks cool. Also we have school today, and it's only that for the week. Cool. Also before I forget, I finished doing the no shampoo for a couple of days experiment. I have too much dandruff because of that lol, or is it? I always have dandruff, yikes. Also I finally finished one of the hardest hunt games in Roblox, Steep Steps. God damn finally.</p>
        <h1>March 25, 2024</h1>
        <p>My parents went for an outing today. And they brought so much food. Our refrigerator was full after that. Also last night I ate the leftover food after their party. Worth the wait.</p>
        <h1>March 24, 2024</h1>
        <p>Didn't expect that The Hunt could get so emotional lol. I'm playing the Roblox Drama Island game and I voted myself because I'm already done with the badge. Gamers were sad there. Anyways, my parents had a party tonight with our Brgy. Captain. Ok then.</p>
        <h1>March 23, 2024</h1>
        <p>Did some Roblox The Hunt events today, because I have nothing anymore to write here. To be honest, I'm having fun here. I only skipped the bad ones so yeah.</p>
        <h1>March 22, 2024</h1>
        <p>Many things happened today, oh well. Anyways, an awarding was announced this morning, and I'm not prepared for that. But before I go there, I got to play Evade Testing again. Cool amiright? Anyways, the Evade Testing ended on the afternoon, and I got to rush washing the clothes. I've never been that fast doing that. And after that I rushed to get to the school now. There's so many students at the library where we're doing the awarding shit :skull:. I'm almost late by the looks of it. And I only got one certificate lol. Also my Mom's here now, because of some kind of emergency from what I've heard. Also it looks like Xen's account on Discord is deleted. I hope he's alright. Damn also I almost forgot again, I animated Ging Waster, with my fucking voice. I better not regret it in the future.</p>
        <h1>March 21, 2024</h1>
        <p>Alright so our contest had a technical problem at the beginning, as expected. I finally found how to fix the problem too. I just changed the sdk compiled at the gradle file, hell yeah. And yeah, we didn't made a functioning code there. Atleast we now know that it's fucking hard.</p>
        <h1>March 20, 2024</h1>
        <p>Procrastinating to learn Android Studio with Java this night because I always do that. Anyways our contest is tomorrow so that's why. Also my mom has a training again this week. She'll be not here until Friday(?). Also my chest hurts because I forced myself to do 20 pushups. Not in one session of course (I have skill issue). Also it looks like I'm going to be active on Reddit again, acting like Ging Waster lol.</p>
        <h1>March 19, 2024</h1>
        <p>Created a shitty art with Wing Gaster. It looks so absurd. Also posted another video on Facebook, featuring a corn dessert. Also discovered another obscure metal band. The first two songs on their first album is sooo good. It will be a ride going to their discography. Also my parents have an event at the basketball court nearby. I can't listen to music peacefully while writing this, the sounds are too loud outside lol.</p>
        <h1>March 18, 2024</h1>
        <p>Uploaded two of my mashups on soundcloud, and made another cover for one of it. It looks funny lol. Also created a very 2017 looking like avatar in Roblox, I must say I prefer finding these types of avatars instead of oreos. Also I used the money left on my wallet to eat some food outside. Bought a local ice cream too while I'm at it. Evade also updated with the St. Patricks day event. They also added some of the overhaul elements there, I'm excited for it.</p>
        <h1>March 17, 2024</h1>
        <p>Am finally home, and I'm suprised that it's faster to get back home rather than going there. Also our codefest contest was moved to 21, damn finally. About that, I only have to go to school for 1 day this week, and it's just that contest. Real shit!? Also finished another Deltarune art, this time it's those funny AU characters that I like. I'm getting faster drawing shit eh?</p>
        <h1>March 16, 2024</h1>
        <p>We went to a resort near the beach today. The one and a half trip was kinda worth it, the beach was good tho. Also that night, I found a cat, she's so friendly. I found her while we're walking by the beach at night. It was relaxing.</p>
        <h1>March 15, 2024</h1>
        <p>Cooked some fried chicken this noon, and I finally perfected the breading. I just washed the chicken lol. Also I forgot to hang the clothes in the dryer, damn it. Also drew Meyton, muh art style is pretty clean tbh. Also I'm getting deep into Error37, found one of their bands too. Pretty dope. Also we're gonna go "vacation" tomorrow to a place. Also it's overnight, better be worth it.</p>
        <h1>March 14, 2024</h1>
        <p>I have no classes tomorrow because of the NYC I mentioned, extended weekend for sure. Also Raven's not here today, I'm so sad in the afternoon classes. I have no one to joke with lol. Also Leo just did our UCSP assignment which we just remembered today. It was given days ago lol. Also I drew some AU this night, I'm obsessed with those things now.</p>
        <h1>March 13, 2024</h1>
        <p>I'm supposed to be in our club meeting today, and it's required. I'm too lazy to go there so... yeah. Also installed TF2 again, I'm bad at this game rn. Haven't played it for months.</p>
        <h1>March 12, 2024</h1>
        <p>I got to play Evaude overhaul this morning, I'm so lucky lol. It was so fun playing it, there's also the developer in the server, it's so chaotic. Also in the math class, we're the last one to finish in the group lol. I'm so serious about the math problem.</p>
        <h1>March 11, 2024</h1>
        <p>A boring day in class today. I'm so sleepy especially in our Research subject lol. Also we currently have the "Anilag Festival" here, that's why my classmates are excited for our early dismissal. Yeah we had an early one. Also there's fireworks this night while I'm writing this, it's gonna be a loud night. Also tried to finish some group work this night, yeah.</p>
        <h1>March 10, 2024</h1>
        <p>Went to church, and it's just like the previous Sundays, nothing much else to say about that. Also my brother's computer finally got replaced, and he have the same specs at me too. Good for him. Did some of my assignments just this night, it's called procrastination btw, have I mentioned it here? Also listened to Linkin Park's new single, it's so good.</p>
        <h1>March 9, 2024</h1>
        <p>Got a haircut again, finally I remembered it the second time. Also I'm starting to draw again, and again. Improvin' till I'm good at drawin'. Also my brother's pc is slow, because he had 4GB of RAM lol. It was fixed now and it's good.</p>
        <h1>March 8, 2024</h1>
        <p>We're supposed to go swimming tomorrow but it got moved due to my sister's activity thing. Still thankful though, I can finally rest at home this weekend. Also we had a make-up class this morning so we're early. Anyways, most of my classmates failed at the table tennis, only around six of us passed. I even played with our PE teacher to demonstrate how to properly play it. Also I don't remember agreeing to go to NYC (not New York City, but the different shit you know), how the fuck did I get listed. Also we had no Math class so there's no 6PM classes, early dismissal for my classmates.</p>
        <h1>March 7, 2024</h1>
        <p>Leo ignored me for 1 hour straight, he pretended that I was a ghost lol. Also I noticed that his personality changed again, that's why he's acting kinda different that morning. Anyways, I posted something again. Also I think I'm starting to like the idea of Plankton screaming, that's what I'm listening to right now this night lol. Also procrastinated again, what a surprise. Currently typing this at exactly 10:30 PM.</p>
        <h1>March 6, 2024</h1>
        <p>I drew some art again today, but I used one for a Youtube cipher thing. Updated my Youtube profile too, looks cool I guess. Also I did the Research activity this night, and it just took me a few minutes to finish it. Procrastination is a bitch. I love reversing music.</p>
        <h1>March 5, 2024</h1>
        <p>Nothing special that happened in school today? What a miracle! Just a normal day at school today, except for the puzzle thing we worked on, and that's pretty much it. Also changed my Discord profile again with some similar symbols, something something...</p>
        <h1>March 4, 2024</h1>
        <p>Met an old classmate while I'm at the jeepney. Niel and I was in the front seat lol. Anyways, I'm not liking how our ICT teacher teach. She just relies too much on the modules given to us, and honestly, I'm not learning anything. I really miss our old ICT teacher. Also I caught on my classmates vapin' at the bathroom. Shit sucks, but I don't wanna be a snitch so yeah.</p>
        <h1>March 3, 2024</h1>
        <p>We didn't went to church today, because most of us is fucking sick lol. So me and my brother just cleaned the leaves in the canals outside of our house. Also went to a nostalgia trip in my Google Photos this night, man I miss high school so much. It's much more fun back then...</p>
        <h1>March 2, 2024</h1>
        <p>Met a Robloxian in the booth game who also listens to Death Grips, we're so chronically online yeah !! Also I tried to listened to JPEGMAFIA after that, I started with the BBC (lol) album, the first song dissed MC Ride lol. Also played an Undertale game on Roblox, it was fun yo!! Oh before I forgot, I formatted my pc and my brother's. It was gettin' slow again.</p>
        <h1>March 1, 2024</h1>
        <p>Our PE teacher is 30 minutes overtime on her previous class, so we waited long before we got there lol. Also I volunteered to be in a 2v2 table tennis match in that class. It's actually fun when I got the hang of it, I even helped until all of us played. Also the boys in the back is actually annoying me now, I'm just tolerating them so I could survive this shit. Also I wasted my memorizing session that morning because I didn't even got called for that, next week I guess.</p>
        <h1>February 29, 2024</h1>
        <p>Went early to school so I'll be never late again, and guess what, my first subject teacher is not present. We just went three hours without any teachers. She didn't even posted any updates on our group chat, damn it. Also I just noticed it's leap year just this night, took me the whole day to figure it out. Also my mom's office is occupied so we ate outside, and met a new friend. His name is Toby and he's pretty chill I'll say, he just sat next to me while we're eating. Also the class created some superheroes for fun, and most of them are serious. I just named mine Banana Man lol. Also tried Undertale Bits and Pieces tonight, the graphics are actually good.</p>
        <h1>February 28, 2024</h1>
        <p>I went at the afternoon for the ThinkFest shit, and oh damn, I didn't expect it to be that hard. All of it are identification of things and most of it are obscure shit that I don't even know. Also I finally finished that animation, and I'm probably guessing it wouldn't get many views on youtube cuz all of my low effort shit gets the most one. I think I probably said this two times now.</p>
        <h1>February 27, 2024</h1>
        <p>When I went to school, I saw my classmate Aiza crying, I didn't what happened when I got there. Also this day was pretty fun and sad at the same time. I felt it after class. Like I think I always get ignored, it's probably just me. Also I've been forced to join to a school activity, welp, there's no going back this time. It's also held tomorrow, damn it.</p>
        <h1>February 26, 2024</h1>
        <p>I found the real life Simoun from El Fili outside of school in LOL. He kinda looks like it and I'm amazed by that ('m probably just overreacting). Also we made a bookmark for our homeroom activity. I drew the sad Berdly meme there lol. Oh yeah I almost forgot, I ALMOST GOT LATE THIS MORNING BECAUSE I GOT DELAYED. I had to ride our car to go to school today man.</p>
        <h1>February 25, 2024</h1>
        <p>We came to church late, so me and my dad was on the back standing. I felt good when I gave up my chair to the old woman. Also listened to "Goodbye Almond Eyes" by Tokyo Rose. Another underrated gem I found by being a Postal fan.</p>
        <h1>February 24, 2024</h1>
        <p>Created another animation, but it's colored this time. Christopher from Deltarune is the one I animated. I'm so proud of my first short animation lol.</p>
        <h1>February 23, 2024</h1>
        <p>We finally had PE class today for the first time lol. Our schedule is unlucky with this class on the first weeks lol. Also the PE class was fun because we played table tennis there. I almost got a 50 consecutive streak for keeping the table tennis ball in the air. Also Raven got sick so he skipped that class, so sad. Also did the Practical Research assignment just this night, cramming is really good yes !!</p>
        <h1>February 22, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finally finished the computer lab activity, and it only took me 10 FUCKING MINUTES. IF THERE'S NO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES I SHOULD'VE BEEN DONE ON DAY 1. Sorry for shouting lol, can't help it. Also the internet's back again, nice. Also when I printed the wrong appendix thing because of the size, my mom got angry at it. She talked to all the teachers about it,  well uh, good I guess?</p>
        <h1>February 21, 2024</h1>
        <p>The internet got cut off again, AND THE DAY WHERE I DON'T HAVE ANY CLASSES. WHY THE FUCK DOES IT ALWAYS DO THAT WHEN I HAVE NO CLASSES.</p>
        <h1>February 20, 2024</h1>
        <p>My reactions in class is so obnoxious that some of my classmates are copying me now LOL. Well, atleast I'm just doing it at the right time when the mood is good. Also my Ralsei meme in Youtube just blew just today, it's been 8 months man. Also Leo is angry at Nem because Nem's copying him. He just told me it, and I understand that.</p>
        <h1>February 19, 2024</h1>
        <p>I haven't finished the computer lab activity, again. Damn it, I got delayed like two times now. Anyways, I wrote sum shit in my wrists in school. A fake clock and a dick lol, I had too much fun. Also in our homeroom class, I ranted about our traditional dish Tinola. I fucking despise it, so I wrote it in a paper. I didn't want to get called because it will get presented in front and most of my classmates rants are serious as shit. Also after class, my family went to a restaurant to eat some pork ribs. It was worth the wait even though it was far. Also before we got there, I found a person laying on the ground face first while inside the car. Oh man, I hope he's alive. It's not the first time I found a person like that, and I hate it.</p>
        <h1>February 18, 2024</h1>
        <p>I fucking played Item Asylum for 3 hours straight. Shall I be proud of it? No. Anyways, we finally finished our editorial writing assignment. It looks so clean. Also I've been listening to the Postal III OST, I never even played that game lol. The OST is good so far. Also played TS!Underswap yesterday, haven't finished it yet.</p>
        <h1>February 17, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finally replaced my mouse, it's smooth now finally. Also I drew an editorial cartoon for a partner activity, looks pretty ok.</p>
        <h1>February 16, 2024</h1>
        <p>So, I shaved the hair of my, you already know. I felt like a new person after I did that LOL. Also I got late in my last exam, and guess what, I'm the first one to finish in our specialized exam. To be fair, I only got late for a couple of minutes and I always answer fast. So yeah. Also we got a club meeting, we elected some new officers and shit. Also my mouse is dying now, it's been good using it. And finally, the verification game is now finally removed from my profile, what a relief.</p>
        <h1>February 15, 2024</h1>
        <p>The abstract exam we took today is nuts. The patterns made my brain hurt. Also I joined the Undertale group in Roblox becuase of a troll lol. Also bought a "fork" accessory in Roblox too, looks funny.</p>
        <h1>February 14, 2024</h1>
        <p>Valentine's day and we have exams, what a nice gift. Anyways we took two exams today, those are English and Math. It's good that they put Math in the first day, no need to worry now. Also bought the "constitution" book that I need by myself. I felt that I'm independent in that moment lol. Also I cooked the chicken this night, and I fucked up the breading mix. The chicken tastes plain because of that. Also about that, when I bite one, I felt a mild pain in my chest. Oh no, I think it's goin' to be bad. I hope not, I don't wanna die yet. Oh yeah, I cooked it because my parents are goin' somewhere and they won't be here until 10 PM, I guess.</p>
        <h1>February 13, 2024</h1>
        <p>We celebrated Valentine's day early, because we have some SHS exams until Friday. I just wore white because I'm too lazy to wear another color, and I'm not interested in our color coding lol. Also while I'm in science class, me and my partner got a zero score on an activity, because we forgot the crust in the earth's four main layers. Also me and Leo drawn some shit in Julian's yellow pad. Quite funny. Also my meme on youtube got 10k view now, ok. Why do always my low effort shit got more views than the ones I actually put on. Life sucks. I'm also writing this thing at 9:49 PM currently because I got some group shit to do. Oh before I forgot, it's my brother's actual birthday today. He already celebrated it on Sunday so yeah.</p>
        <h1>February 12, 2024</h1>
        <p>I haven't done my first activity in the computer lab because of the slow internet lol. Just gonna wait until the next meeting to finish it. Anyways, there's a traffic jam when we're about to go home, it's just stuck there for a couple minutes fortunately. Also I'm watching Undertale videos again on youtube, especially Shayy's one. I'm getting back to my Undertale days again. Also I joined the Deltarune Roblox group again just to troll, probably.</p>
        <h1>February 11, 2024</h1>
        <p>My brother celebrated his birthday in a restaurant with his classmate. I didn't want to come cause I'm lazy rn. Anyways, I still haven't read the story we have to read for tomorrow. Procrastination at its finest.</p>
        <h1>February 10, 2024</h1>
        <p>Item Asylum finally updated now, new chaos will ensue. Also the tiles are now finished from yesterday. It's lookin' good now. Also I noticed that my right nostril is runny. It's only that part, how though.</p>
        <h1>February 9, 2024</h1>
        <p>I helped my dad while he's placing some new tiles in our pozo. I got shouted at when I can't find the fucking tin can. Meh. Also created a parody of an Undertale Yellow meme, basically the opposite of it. Also it looks like the verification game that I thought will be removed, will probably be stuck in my profile for a long time. The creator said that archiving the game doesn't work. Welp, it's my fate now lol.</p>
        <h1>February 8, 2024</h1>
        <p>We only had one class today lol, what a day. Also we don't have classes tomorrow, because our president moved the holiday to Friday. Also we went to a roasting place tonight, and it's mid. The food was good, but the service is not. Atleast there's two cats there lol.  Also I noticed our Discord server is slowly dying, maybe it's just this week. Friends rarely talk anymore.</p>
        <h1>February 7, 2024</h1>
        <p>I recovered some old files from my laptop, mostly the memes and old profile pics I used. I can't recover the other shit because I only have the free version lol. And I got scolded because I'm using this computer too much, well fuck. Anyways, I animated a short gif, it was already good for me. Still practicing animation, I might get better who knows.</p>
        <h1>February 6, 2024</h1>
        <p>So I went early to school to apply for a student job, and I'm not fucking qualified. I just wasted my time there, damn it. Anyways our afternoon was funny. I even asked our math teacher about food lol. Also added the funny website that I made here, why not. Also I backed up my Roblox pictures and videos again in my cloud storage. Gotta keep the memories :3</p>
        <h1>February 5, 2024</h1>
        <p>Alright so the first day of school is cold, literally. I was shivering all the time in our new classroom because it's so fucking cold lol. Anyways, new teachers and subjects again. Also got rashes on my to school on my hands, idk why. I just noticed that it was frequently happening in my body too. It's itchy and annoying man. Okay so I'm in the morning now while writing this sentence, because last night our electricity went off for a few seconds, TWO FUCKING TIMES WHILE I'M WRITING THIS. I just went to bed because of that shit.</p>
        <h1>February 4, 2024</h1>
        <p>Got a fresh haircut today, this is one of the few moments I will write this in my diary because I always fucking forget. Also my phone's button is now finally fixed, satisfaction. Also trying out animation again this night, I'm just a beginner so yeah. Also I have school now tomorrow, back to reality I guess.</p>
        <h1>February 3, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finally talked to the creator of the Roblox extension I had. The verification game is stuck in my favorite for months now lol. They said they will archive it soon, which I hope will remove it from my favorites. Also my siblings made a homemade ice cream, and it was pretty good. Only tasted a bit though, it's too sweet.</p>
        <h1>February 2, 2024</h1>
        <p>People really liked the mashup of "the thing", guess it sounds good after all. Anyways school is very near now, can't wait to see our new classmate. There's only one so far based on a group chat that was created for our section.</p>
        <h1>February 1, 2024</h1>
        <p>Goddamn it's February already? Time flies so fast. Anyways, I finally beated Deltatraveller in the genocide route, nothing that much changed in the ending. I beat sans in one try this time. Also I added bio.link in my website miscellaneous section. Useful? Probably.</p>
        <h1>January 31, 2024</h1>
        <p>So my siblings have school now, and I'm still at home. Good. Anyways, I finally saw my grades now. I got 92, not bad. Also they brought pizza too this night, but it's small lol.</p>
        <h1>January 30, 2024</h1>
        <p>Did another video about Undertale, then I realized it sucks after I finished it lol. Anyways, my mom got my grades now, and I didn't even saw it. She said she'll show it tomorrow, I hope so. Also, I did a "The World Revolving" mashup with a metal instrument and vocals. It sounds frickin' good.</p>
        <h1>January 29, 2024</h1>
        <p>I'm listening to Error37 again, so sad that they only made a handful of songs so far. I'm excited to listen to their upcoming album. Man, their songs are so good. Also drew something related to them, still a wip though.</p>
        <h1>January 28, 2024</h1>
        <p>That church mass we took today is perfect, until those two kids started making noises. I hate children man. Also I'm just straight up ignoring the insults from my siblings now. Honestly satisfying.</p>
        <h1>January 27, 2024</h1>
        <p>I'm starting to ignore my brother's insult, it's for the better lol. And guess what, nothing really much happened today blah blah blah.</p>
        <h1>January 26, 2024</h1>
        <p>A very cold day today, climate change is really real. Anyways, a Postal dude cosplayer added me in Roblox while in-game, yes I'm wearing a Postal avatar too. Also a very nostalgic night too, reminds me of my early days of playing Evade. Oh, and I got level 200 on January 20, I always forgot to wrote some good shit lol. Also I'm currently trying Cruelty Squad. Really hard, but a fun stealth game.</p>
        <h1>January 25, 2024</h1>
        <p>Nothin' really much happened today, just a typical day, eh.</p>
        <h1>January 24, 2024</h1>
        <p>So our water heater is broken, didn't drank any coffee today. Anyways, I finished Postal 1 and Postal Redux at the same time. It was edgy I'll say, the Redux one is much more fun. Also my brother tried Lambda Fortress with me, it was fun playing it. Also my mom's voice is pretty funny right now, she can't even shout lol. Also her speaker exploded when she tried to do Zumba again. A fucking lizard crawl in it and it got electrocuted.</p>
        <h1>January 23, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finally finished Gladihopper, again. Only took me two days to finish it, it was a fun game though. Also nothin' much happened today, yep. Oh yeah also this code is almost 1000 lines now, time to get to 2000 lines until next year.</p>
        <h1>January 22, 2024</h1>
        <p>I left all my Roblox groups today, I really hope I don't regret that. I'm on my 2020 life again. Oh the misery. Also the tables of the computers of my siblings are rearranged. I'm now solo in this table lol.</p>
        <h1>January 21, 2024</h1>
        <p>It was a fun day today. I went to McDonalds to wait for the others and I found Josh first. And the others came, then we went to Masato's house. We had a small reunion if I'll say. We talked about our life and things as usual. And Lukas never did his "promised" D reveal. If you're reading this Lukas, fuck you. Also it was fun playing with the toy guns there, I even looked like a certain security guard with my bandana mask. Also I'm back to using dark mode now, it was fun using light mode.</p>
        <h1>January 20, 2024</h1>
        <p>The kitty of Audrey that looks similar to her got hit by a vehicle, apparently. It was sad losing that kitty, she's probably the nicest one in the three kittens. Also I finally completed Portal 1, the cake was a lie all along. Time to finish Portal 2 next year. Also my sister went for a sleepover today, she's not gonna be here tonight. And my parents for an outing, they're still not here while I'm writing this tonight. Also we had a vc tonight talking about our hangout tomorrow on Sato's house. Also watched Sato's Oversimplified stream about the punic war, it was interesting. Also created an Undertale Yellow meme video, it was funnier in my head.</p>
        <h1>January 19, 2024</h1>
        <p>I finished drawing the three main characters of Deltarune. Susie took me the most time lol. Also posted my old drawings on Twitter again. I don't have anything good to do today.</p>
        <h1>January 18, 2024</h1>

I hope they "fix" it soon. Also I picked up my brother from a restaurant because we're about to go home lol. Also I'm still fucking coughing, and I hate it.</p>
        <h1>January 17, 2024</h1>
        <p>Feeling a bit ok now, I still hate it when I need to fucking cough. Anyways, we took three tests today, mostly the hard ones. Math still sucks though, probably my skill issue lol. Also I posted two of my drawings in Twitter, idk I feel like it. Also met Kurt, Denver, and Ver this day. I can't wait to go on the 21th for our meetup.</p>
        <h1>January 16, 2024</h1>
        <p>I just noticed I had two weird dreams consecutively today. Is it because I'm sick? Probably. Also took two tests today, we gonna do this until Thursday. 21st Century exam was hard. Yes, I didn't review for it. Also when we need to go now, my mom gave us pizza and some lasagna first lol. Also in the jeepney, I feel bad for myself. Those drivers don't get paid enough. Still, I still feel sick today. What a good timing. </p>
        <h1>January 15, 2024</h1>
        <p>My mom forced me and my brother to drink water every hour lol. Still, it's good for us. Also I'm feeling sick today and I have exams tomorrow. I hope I'm ok tomorrow.</p>

        <h1>January 13, 2024</h1>
        <p>Finally finished the "Do Not Research Iceberg" videos today. Took me a couple of days lol. That was worth it, or probably not.</p>
        <h1>January 12, 2024</h1>
        <p>Went to the school for our film fest. We only watched the films made by our section lol. Ignoring the fillers, all of them are pretty decent. Then I go home after that, that's all.</p>
        <h1>January 11, 2024</h1>
        <p>Nothing much happened today. Btw Raven actually bought the school uniform in Roblox that I made. I thought he was johking lol.</p>
        <h1>January 10, 2024</h1>
        <p>No classes until tomorrow, yipee. Also my sister got sick so she stayed at home, and I took her things at the school. I miss elementary school, oh wait nvm high school was better.</p>

We are the audience, so we just listened to them. Also we did our group assignment this night. Procrastination at its finest.</p>
        <h1>January 7, 2024</h1>
        <p>This day is pretty crazy tbh. Okay so today THE FUCKING INTERNET IS OUT AGAIN WHAT THE FUCK. Sigh, I hate our internet provider man. Also went to the church, probably the most peaceful mass so far. Also we went to our grandma again to eat, because our cousin's mom is going abroad again. We only see her like once a year or so. Also after going home, I've finished the code of our game. Took me that long for the procrastination huh. Also the kittens, I almost forgot, is missing that morning. This afternoon, the two kittens came back, but the black one is missing. My parents assumpted that the kids outside our house played with it. Oh man, I hope that didn't happen. Also this night, Leo is having an existensial crisis. Like, what's the meaning of life, why are we living. Life is pain.</p>
        <h1>January 6, 2024</h1>
        <p>Busy watching some iceberg videos today. I enjoy that that type of content in Youtube. Also I'm experiencing some weird shit when I wake up early in the morning. It's like I can't sleep once I woke up. What the fuck, my mind doesn't wanna, but my body does. Oh noes. Also my Mom prepared some red wine for us this night. It's so delicous.</p>
        <h1>January 5, 2024</h1>

Also new BMTH single just dropped. Another AmeN! type song. Pretty cool. Also played Deltatravel section 3, Sans was pretty hard, but I still beat it. Also did the Genocide run too after that, I'm going to suffer more lol.</p>
        <h1>January 4, 2024</h1>
        <p>I'm supposed to go to our meeting place for our ILS but it got cancelled again lol. Luckily I haven't left the house yet. We're gonna continue it tomorrow. Anyways, a repairman went to our house and fixed our modem. And unfortunately, a cable problem was there after our modem got replaced. So I have no internet while typing this shit. Hope they will fix it tomorrow. Also I'm redrawing my interpretation of Death Grips covers because I'm so fucking bored. I drawn the three on the top so far.</p>
        <h1>January 3, 2024</h1>

        <p>Geometry Dash 2.2 released today. There's still some problems loading from the server, but finally it's here.

Time to do the other route. If you know what I mean.</p>
        <h1>December 19, 2023</h1>

Also our cat Mohawk gave birth to two kittens last week. I just wrote it rn because yeah, I ALWAYS forget..</p>
        <h1>December 15, 2023</h1>
        <p>Mom and Dad isn't in the school today, so I had to eat in the classroom. The lasagna is so good, also the bread too. Also the jeepney I rode is fuckin' full, and my parents called exactly at 4:00 PM, which is is my out time, to pick me up. They are on the school and I didn't even notice it. When I'm near home, they're just getting in the house with the car. Fuck.</p>
        <h1>December 14, 2023</h1>
        <p>I meet my old neighbor's dog on my way outside. I think it's been years since I saw her. Also I finally finished the speech thing, and it only took me one try. I almost fumbled it phew. Also did a final memorization for an act in our last subject. My partner is Raven luckily. Our lines is funny because one of us is supposed to be a woman. Also it's been a week and two days since I didn't drink coffee. I just wrote this tonight because I just remembered it and I always tend to forget things lol.</p>
        <h1>December 13, 2023</h1>
        <p>I memorized my speech this afternoon, I really hope I don't mess this up tomorrow. Also I'm still busy this night doing the ILS stuff, fuck.</p>
        <h1>December 12, 2023</h1>
        <p>I officially hit 10,000 scrobbles on Last.FM, very nice. Also I did a goofy website on HTML with gradients. Also included animations which our teacher hasn't still taught us yet. It's so funny I downloaded it in my phone. Also I finally figured out the code, oh I hope it doesn't go messy.</p>
        <h1>December 11, 2023</h1>
        <p>The hell week starts now. There's so many shit we have to do, including our fucking ILS. Welp, our semester's gonna end soon now. Also I'm actually nervous for my speech on Thursday. Some of the one who did the speech today is fumbling while speaking. Also we finally have some communication in our ILS, god damn finally.</p>
        <h1>December 10, 2023</h1>
        <p>I really hate those annoying kids at the church. It fucking distracts me man. Also our ILS leader is furious to us again lol Also tried Undertale Yellow today, I'mma try to beat it in the pacifist route. Also played Opposing Force too yesterday, I finally got through the alien thing.</p>
        <h1>December 9, 2023</h1>
        <p>We went to my grandfather's birthday celebration. And my father's brother forced me to socialize with people. I hate that when people forces me from doing something. I'm upset at that moment. Also did some Evade trimping this night to record it. Worth it.</p>
        <h1>December 8, 2023</h1>
        <p>I posted a Reddit post about Noelle's antlers, but it's called "boners". I expected what will happen in the comments section lol. Also got a fresh haircut today, though it took longer than usual. Also Jay went to practice in the court near our house. He visits me for water lol. </p>
        <h1>December 7, 2023</h1>
        <p>I came at school again too early, so I bought a croissant and water. Worth it. Also did some exercise for our PE class, I was too tired after that lol. Also Leo and I sat in another class (not our section), there's no teacher so it's ok 👍. Also on our 21st Century class, we watched a play. Honestly, it's boring. It's good that our teacher made the activity a homework. Also I fucking chased Leo after class, I'm too tired for that man. I still gave him the middle finger tho.</p>
        <h1>December 6, 2023</h1>
        <p>Busy Wednesday because of the assignments and shit. Also did the soyjak pointing me at my poster assignment lol. I look goofy there. Also drew a comic strip for an another assignment too. Really testin' my drawing skill there. Also my Mom is not gonna be here tonight, I think she will have a seminar, I guess.</p>
        <h1>December 5, 2023</h1>
        <p>I speedran our Java activity again. And our teacher has no more Java activity to give to me, I still doubt that lol. Also I missed my Philosophy quiz in our online thing, I fucking missed 50 points. I also met Bon and Chax yesterday, and Bon just called me the fucking N word, neat. Also an earthquake was felt while I was in the office, it was pretty strong they said. I didn't even felt it because I was outside. Also I now surpassed Death Grips on my Last.fm, with BMTH. Still, Death Grips is my favorite band. BMTH is still a banger tho.</p>
        <h1>December 4, 2023</h1>
        <p>I did a reporting in our 21st Century thing, it's honestly kinda boring lol. Also I got 32th place in our Oral Comm speech thing, I really wanna go first since anxiety is worse.

        <p>First time participating in the church, I just litted up the candle. That's tough, lol. Also while we are buying stuff with the family, I put the sandals that my brother put in the cart back. My mom didn't notice it lol. Anyways I wear sandals now inside, to prevent my feet getting cold I guess. Also my friends are ranting in the Discord server at night rn, better not interrupt them. Also we did gartic phone this late at night, it was fucking fun.</p>
        <h1>December 2, 2023</h1>

        <h1>November 27, 2023</h1>
        <p>I got two fucking wet dreams in a row. I HATE MY LIFE. Anyways, I found a good PvE Roblox game, mostly played it this day. Also I finally finished "If Undertale was Realistic", two days ago. It was a funny series, worth the watch.</p>

        <p>Yep, the expected thing happened. We are not prepared for the roleplay thing and we have to do it again next meeting. Goddamnit. Also the ice cream machine in the ministop is now back. And the flavor was the salted caramel thingy. Not a fan of it though. Also my sister got top place on a journalism competition so my parents bought some good chicken with a good sauce. Truly the food of all time.<p>

        <h1>November 16, 2023</h1>
        <p>My dad brought me halfway to my school because of rain, and the jeepneys are full again. Luckily there's a vacant jeepney after I got out. Also we're only half-day today. The subjects teacher got sick, damn. Also on my way home, I suddenly remebered we have a practice before we go home. The practice got moved tomorrow lol because most of my groupmates are on the way home too. Also visited the "trading website" again. Posted a thing with a code to a video.</p>

Also I waited a long time in line just to get some chicken nuggets because their chicken is not available in the store. I wanna get out of this hellhole of a country (probably not). Also my younger brother tried to verify his payment app, and he forgot the pin. Bruh. Also in the class yesterday, they didn't even approach me during Oral Comm for the groupings. How am I supposed to know what group I am. I joined the group chat today anyways, and they didn't even invite me there too. Oh right, the Roblox VC is not permanent lol. I just found out about it today. It's good while it lasted. Also met Neil on the jeepney, an old classmate.</p>
        <h1>November 13, 2023</h1>
        <p>Leo is absent again, and I feel like shit in school. He's my only true close friend there, I'm really fucking bad at socializing. Oh well, can't do anything about it then. Also I'm having fun using vc on Roblox, it's really goofy. Oh I hope I don't get banned while using vc. (Please don't jinx it my November 13 self).</p>
        <h1>November 12, 2023</h1>
        <p>We went to church again, didn't mostly enjoy it at first. I blame those noisy children in there. After that, we ate at the foodcourt, and my dad met his old teacher there. I had a short, awkward conversation with her lol. Also our chicken got butchered now, and I fucking ate it. Oh well, it was delicious atleast. Also I accidentally got the voice chat feature on Roblox when I used a VPN. I think it's permanent now when I turned the VPN off lol.</p>
        <h1>November 11, 2023</h1>
        <p>I shaved my moustache today, I look much cleaner with just my beard. I also watched "The Amazing Digital Circus", and yeah, Caine does actually acts like Spamton in the show. The show was good I guess.</p>
        <h1>November 10, 2023</h1>
        <p>I "accidentally" tried the free trial of Discord nitro, it only redeems in mobile I guess. Also I had a hard time getting into a jeepney this morning, I woke up later than usual lol. Also I passed the HTML and Java test, didn't surprise me fr. Also in our nath time, it's fun lol. We just had games and shit like that, and it's all about math. Math is fun when it's interesting. Also we watched some film trailers that students made including us today. Most of them are about horror and romance lol. Also I drank coffee while waiting in the office in the afternoon. Welp, I still feel sleepy while writing this thing.</p>
        <h1>November 9, 2023</h1>
        <p>This day today is very good, until it wasn't lol. Long story short, our teachers revealed our scores, and I passed both two test. And my friends passed too, nice. When it's our 21st Century time, our teacher gave us a warning that most of our groupmates didn't contribute. Well, mostly all of us contributed anyways. Also my mom gave us a task, and me and Leo got a free donut. </p>
        <h1>November 8, 2023</h1>
        <p>Used a file recovery tool on my disk today, I found my old Warcraft III files there. I feel like an old man right now lol. Also did a fucking dance exercise for a subject, and I have surpassed the 1 minute mark. I hope that my teacher will still accept it. </p>
        <h1>November 7, 2023</h1>
        <p>Drew myself again with a christmas hat as my Facebook profile pictire lol. Also posted a roblox meme in my story while I'm at it too. Also took my two last exams today. Both are easy, so no worries. Also I finally verified my payment app after a year. I didn't feel lazy this time lol.</p>
        <h1>November 6, 2023</h1>
        <p>We had two exams today. The last part of our Java exam is, well, coding in a fucking paper. I can't even remember the scanner one without looking at the questions. Also me and Raven waited long for Leo lol, apparently he hasn't received the discount for the tution thing. Also in our way to the ministop, a kitten delayed us. It keeps meowing on us, maybe it's distressed?</p>
        <h1>November 5, 2023</h1>
        <p>We went to the church today, inside a mall. Didn't know that a church inside a mall exists lol. Also after that we ate too. All of that is an early celebration of my Dad's birthday. We have school tomorrow lol.</p>
        <h1>November 4, 2023</h1>
        <p>I woke up very early in the morning and can't sleep for a bit. Probably because it's hot? Also changed my pfp in Discord with my alt to the Christmas one. Early celebration eh. Also my grandmother also went here for a bit, they're gonna wait for the x-ray thingy.</p>
        <h1>November 3, 2023</h1>
        <p>Took the three tests this afternoon, and the math one is the only thing that is hard this day. What a surprise. Also my Dad brought a chicken last night. I don't even know if he's going to cook it or making it a pet. Also I sat on the entrance of the jeepney, because it was full, with an old elementary friend. It was nice talking to him.</p>
        <h1>November 2, 2023</h1>
        <p>I have some exams tomorrow, goodluck to me I guess. Also my website is now officially 1 year old. I forgot to say this on November 1 since it's the date of it.</p>
        <h1>November 1, 2023</h1>
        <p>What a good start of November, of course. I've been forced to go to the complex again this afternoon, and I mostly didn't enjoy it. Also the Evade halloween and overhaul was supposed to be released today, and it got delayed again. Hopefully it will be okay tomorrow.</p>
        <h1>October 31, 2023</h1>
        <p>My parents went home early today, I'm suprised lol. Also our cat Audrey gave birth to three kittens. Each have different colors. Also changed my Discord avatar to Papyrus, it's halloween time.</p>

        <h1>October 29, 2023</h1>
        <p>We went to my grandma's birthday today. They said that I'm so tall in my age lmao. Also went to the grocery too after that.</p>
        <h1>October 28, 2023</h1>
        <p>My father added a sink in our garden outside. Like wtf, my mother is the only one that will use it lol. And I had another sweaty Item Asylum session this night lol. I really love underrated Roblox games man.</p>
        <h1>October 27, 2023</h1>
        <p>We had math class again, and I can't understand a single shit. Meh, where am I going to use that knowledge anyways (I might regret saying this lol.). Also I finally got bird up in Item Asylum, got it by stealing someone's "judge" lol. Also rode the wrong fucking jeep. I really need to read those signs this time.</p>
        <h1>October 26, 2023</h1>
        <p>I showered last night, because my hair is fucking itchy. Well, it's a relief for me. Also my cat Mohawk fucking ate half of the fish in our kitchen. I really hate that cat.</p>
        <h1>October 25, 2023</h1>
        <p>I played Midnight Horrors again, it's still fun grinding some survivals lol. Also I'll be trying to use Microsoft Edge for a while, it looks faster than Chrome so why not give it a try.</p>
        <h1>October 24, 2023</h1>
        <p>I forgot to mention that there's a short pipe leak in our house yesterday. My pinky finger bled after I used the mop. Unlucky me. Also today I finally finished that array java thing that our teacher gave to us. Only two of us is done with that shit lol. Also after that I ate some siomai with Leo, and went home after that. And while I'm playing Evade at 8PM, he joined too lol. It's just short so yeah.</p>
        <h1>October 23, 2023</h1>
        <p>We took a test and checked it today. Me and Leo got the same passing score lol. Luckily I read the reviewer my teacher sent. Also I made the Evade game-discussion channel delusional for a bit, we really need the overhaul update now lol.</p>
        <h1>October 22, 2023</h1>
        <p>I went to complex, by just walking. That was worth it, I guess. Also I met Jay there too, he's there to practice with his classmates. Also I now like Jevil as a character, for some reason. Chaos? Also the Roblox servers today are so fucking laggy, it's because of just ONE Blox Fruit update, JUST ONE.</p>
        <h1>October 21, 2023</h1>
        <p>Finally got Robux after about 4 months of waiting, worth the wait. Bought some more cosplays because of that. Nothing much happened today.</p>
        <h1>October 20, 2023</h1>
        <p>Now I feel really sick today, and I feel cold too. Also there are only few jeepneys when I'm waiting in the afternoon. So I just rode in the car with my parents home. Before that, me and my mom went to a store to buy some food and stuff. And waited for my brother in my previous high school. What a tiring day. Also I found a good Aphex Twin track, and I might get into this artist too.</p>
        <h1>October 19, 2023</h1>
        <p>I'm waiting for a jeepney this rainy morning, and my dad distracted me from an available one. I had to wait another fucking minutes for that. Also we danced on our PE class, and I didn't even memorized the dance. I just improvised and copied the better dancers lol. Also I almost finished Undertale again on true pacifist. I beaten this game many times now lol. Also I feel sick after school, god damn rain. Also we met some of our old classmates today after I guessed it. Coincidence? Probably. Also I (ChatGPT) wrote the Meet The Madcap script from TF2, a fucking joke class. I posted it in the Steam forums, and people don't like it lol. Anyways I don't care anymore about it.</p>
        <h1>October 18, 2023</h1>
        <p>Elca used my funny blender render as his Facebook cover. I'm confused on how he got that. Oh well, it's easy to make tho. Also it's Kas's birthday today, I can finally send that buff soldier meme. Also greeted Jay too, even though it's 6 days late. Better than nothing. Also resetted my phone back to default, I think it's much faster.</p>
        <h1>October 17, 2023</h1>
        <p>Our computer progamming teacher is sick, so we don't have any lessons this morning and afternoon. Early dismissal for us yeah. Also drew the album cover of Dalek and Death Grips combined, looks sick.Also we had test for Philosophy, I only did good on the essay part lol. Also my pants got dripped by  chocolate while I'm eating chocolate bread. I hope my parents don't notice it. Also I'm now planning our text-based game in paint.net, and progamming it in java. Why did they make me a leader man.</p>
        <h1>October 16, 2023</h1>
        <p>I woke up early today, I thought my class was 7AM lol. Also I tried Firefox again, and I just uninstalled it again cause of some website compatibility issues. Fuck you Chrome for dominating the internet. Also we supposed to have no classes because of a jeepney strike, and we're not included in it bruh. Because of that, when I'm waiting for a jeepney, it's always full lol. Took me a while to get one. Also I played Omori for the first time, I'll probably regret this.</p>
        <h1>October 15, 2023</h1>
        <p>Forgot to mention that I had a weird dream yesterday. I'm being chased in some kind of small building. I'm in some stairs and I escaped, but with my limbs chopped lol. Weekend dreams are so bizzare man. Also I discovered another experimental hip hop group. Their first song is so good. I might get into this band, maybe. Also we went to the complex again this morning, this time they brought a volleyball. I didn't even get to play it lol.</p>
        <h1>October 14, 2023</h1>

        <h1>October 13, 2023</h1>
        <p>We're only half-day today, nice. Also they said they felt an earthquake, but I didn't notice it. Probably because I was buying on recess lol. Also BMTH just released a new single today, goddamn it sounds good, as always. Can't wait for their Nex Gen album. Also it's Friday the 13th today, doesn't feel like it lol.</p>
        <h1>October 12, 2023</h1>
        <p>Our teacher in Oral Comm didn't come, he's probably mad at us. Also Raven went to the office the first time, he's a trusted recruit now lol. Also when I went to the Ministop with Leo, we talked about his other personalities. He apparently had DID, a disorder. I'm really confused and amazed on how a person can do that.</p>
        <h1>October 11, 2023</h1>
        <p>Mah internet is acting up rn, can't even play Roblox with a completely loaded game. Why am I so unlucky when there's no classes man. Also found a good song by Mike Shinoda, a co-founder of Linkin Park. His song is so loopable god damn./p>
        <h1>October 10, 2023</h1>
        <p>We have no math again man, it's been a week without it. Our teacher was sick bruh. Also a friend took a shit on the school bathroom, and I had to guard him LOL. Also it's my sisters birthday today, and a delicious chocolate cake was brought. Also I'm starting to get deep into Linkin Park, and found out that High Voltage by YFM was a cover of a Linkin Park song. Damn it's good.</p>

Also we had no classes with teaching today, everyone's preparing for the teachers' day (today). Also when we ate at the office, there's some fuckin good food there. We don't need to buy food yes. Also I wore a mask from "Money Heist" while listening to Death Grips, inside the classroom. I look goofy there lol. Also I went to the mall with my mom afterschool, it's boring there. They need to set up things for tomorrow, yeah I'm gonna go to the same mall again. Also I'm trying to make our school room in Roblox.

I think we're the best one to perform, based on my teacher's rating. She didn't like the whole class' performance tho. Real. Also while I'm in a jeepney, my teacher was there too. And guess what, she's our 21st Century teacher.</p>
        <h1>September 20, 2023</h1>
        <p>We had a club meeting this afternoon today. There's so many students that joined here, probably because of the online game lol. Anyways, we practiced for our Oral Comm roleplay. We didn't use any verbal words during that. It's really hard doing that, but it's fun lol. Also my parents letted an old friend in the house. If I heard correctly, he needs some help. I feel sad for him. Also changed my Discord profile again. Full of ciphers, like I always do.</p>

Also I accidentally bled my right hand because I was running, and my sister opened the door. It's not that bad, but it removed my skin. Also posted a meme on my Facebook story. I haven't used that thing in years.</p>

        <p>Finished my resume, I hope it's enough. Also Jay showed me an "interesting" game called Fear and Hunger. I tried it out, also he said that I should use the censored version. Stupid me did the uncensored one first, and guess what. I got an r scene at my first playthrough. Hell yeah... Also I love changing mah custom Discord rich presence, I can add stupid things. </p>
        <h1>June 21, 2023</h1>

        <h1>June 17, 2023</h1>
        <p>Finally, Microsoft Rewards added the Robux option after TWO FUCKING MONTHS. I guess it's worth the wait. Also did a little digging again, but only three times cuz it's hot outside. We also went outside to eat some mixed ice shit, yeah it's a delicacy.</p>
        <h1>June 16, 2023</h1>
        <p>Finally got my username on Discord, no more tags bitches. Also played Nico's Nextbot, but I'm the bot. It's fucking fun. Also played Serious Sam 3 again, now it's running good after the replacement of my motherboard. I'm also almost done watching Xavier from yesterday, so sad there's only 20 total episodes damn. Also edited Death Grips - Fuck Me Out to only saying fuck the whole time, also I included the moan there. And uploaded it to youtube, then it got age-restricted. Not surprised LMAO.</p>
        <h1>June 15, 2023</h1>

        <h1>June 14, 2023</h1>
        <p>So I presented in English without any preparations lol. It's about our term fest, and our presentation theme is uhm, questionable. Black and orange title shit, you know what I mean. Also Rom has done more stupid shit, Lai sent some screenshots again so I knew, it in the past, how is he still here. Also tried the yogurt drink on our typical tea shop, it's, fucking, good.</p>
        <h1>June 13, 2023</h1>
        <p>Chaotic day today. The situation about Rom is worse now, parents are needed here in school. They discussed along with my friends who joined the conversation on the "accident" that Lai started. Anyways, me, Kas, Nel, and Lan went to a canteen near the tea shop we're usually in. The chicken there is too much for me lol. Also only payed like 80% to Kas, he gave us free fries lol. Also we migrated to a new fresh gc because of that "accident". A new start eh. Also we got fucking scolded again by our adviser, shit's real bad. Just when we're about to graduate, and things go horribly wrong.</p>
        <h1>June 12, 2023</h1>
        <p>Did our English-Research shit this night, as always.</p>

Also found a really fire Guillotine remix, sounds better than the original one. Also played Zombie Uprising again, the first Roblox game I played on this account I have.</p>
        <h1>June 9, 2023</h1>
        <p>Welp, the sitution with Rom got worse. Our adviser is mad at us again lol. Also Lai and Rom talked with their parents after the "lecturing". Lai apparently started all of this. Luckily I'm not affected, cuz I didn't say shit. Also we thought the leaker of our group chat is Cia, but we're wrong. I hate doing assumptions man. Also we had a dance on PE, and I had no practice cuz I didn't go yesterday. It was literally the same dance again, and it's easy.</p>
        <h1>June 8, 2023</h1>
        <p>Yep, I didn't go to school cuz I got THE FEVER (AYE AYE). But for real I have a flu. I'll try to go to school tomorrow I guess. Also our fucking group chat got leaked. So that's why my alt got kicked hmm (alt purge). I think we're fucked up, or not. Apparently, Rom found our shit, now another reason to hate him.</p>
        <img src="Assets\Images\Diary\berdly_sad.gif">
        <h1>June 7, 2023</h1>

        <p>Did a website overhaul, again, in my site. Cleaned up the codes and also used Visual Stuido to do it. I'm now satisfied in my site. Also next time I will learn how to make my site more responsive. Also I'm going to stop "optimizing" my code, It's <strong>really</strong> fucking hard to understand the code when I do that.</p>
        <h1>December 14, 2022</h1>
        <p>Forgot to write my diary yesterday so I'm writing it today(December 15). It's our last school day on the year today, so I brought a gun for fun(toy gun). Also our christmas party is good. Funny games and good foods. Also drew some memes on our "Freedom Wall". Also one of my classmates and another girl talked to the rooftop of our building. After they go down, we go to the rooftop to look. We got caught by a guard, lmao. We only live once so, yeah. Also to end the party, my pals and I go to a coffee shop. Also free fries bought by a friend. All in all, a funny day.</p>

        <h1>November 3, 2022</h1>
